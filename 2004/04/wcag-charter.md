<span id="mission">1. Mission</span>
------------------------------------

<span class="change">The mission of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group](/WAI/GL/) (WCAG WG) is</span> to develop guidelines to make Web content accessible for people with disabilities. In particular, the WCAG WG will publish the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 as a W3C Recommendation.

<span class="change">This mission is complementary to the work of other [Web Accessibility Initiative](/WAI/) (WAI) groups within the [WAI Technical Activity](/WAI/Technical/Activity) and the [WAI International Program Office Activity](/WAI/IPO/Activity). The WCAG WG is part of the WAI Technical Activity.</span>

<span class="change">The WCAG WG was first chartered in [August 1997 (charter)](/WAI/GL/charter.html) to produce [WCAG 1.0](/TR/WCAG10/) which became a W3C Recommendation in May 1999. The WCAG WG was rechartered in [November 2000 (charter)](/WAI/GL/new-charter-2000.html) to continue W3C's work on guidelines for creating accessible Web content</span><span class="change">.</span>The early history of this group is documented in the "[End of Charter Report for the Web Content Guidelines Working Group](/WAI/GL/end-charter2-report.html)." The group is being rechartered to allow additional time for development of WCAG 2.0.

<span id="scope">2. Scope</span>
--------------------------------

The WCAG WG's scope of work includes:

1.  Advance WCAG 2.0 to a W3C Recommendation
2.  Develop techniques for implementing the WCAG 2.0 in [W3C Recommendations](http://www.w3.org/TR/#Recommendations) (such as XHTML, SMIL, SVG, and MathML) as well as ECMAScript
3.  <span class="change">Develop a test suite for WCAG 2.0 in coordination with other WAI Working Groups</span>
4.  <span class="change">Document implementation testing experience of WCAG 2.0</span>

Consistent with [W3C Process requirements on Task Forces](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/Process-20040205/process.html#ReqsAllGroups), the WCAG WG may <span class="rfc2119"></span>form **task forces** composed of WCAG WG participants or join other W3C task forces to carry out assignments when under the chartered scope of WCAG WG. Any such task force must have a work statement (including objectives, communication, participation, and leadership) that has been announced on the WCAG WG mailing list, approved by the WCAG WG, and is available from the WCAG WG home page. WCAG WG task forces should produce requirements documents that outline the scope and expectations for work. Task forces may set up separate teleconferences and hold face-to-face meetings per the W3C process and with the approval of the WCAG WG.

<span id="duration">3. Duration</span>
--------------------------------------

The Working Group is scheduled for 24 months, from 1 January 2005 through 31 December 2006<span class="change">.</span>
