### <span class="expand_section">First Public Working Draft: Accessibility of Remote Meetings</span>

<span class="dtstart published" title="2021-10-14T07:46:24Z"> 14 October 2021 </span> | [Archive](https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/9286 "Archive: First Public Working Draft: Accessibility of Remote Meetings")

The [Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/) has published a First Public Working Draft of [Accessibility of Remote Meetings](https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/WD-remote-meetings-20211014/). Remote meeting is an umbrella term used to describe real-time discussions or presentations held between two or more parties online. The issues faced by people with disabilities will vary depending on the implementation of accessibility requirements and current limitations of remote meeting software. While W3C has applicable guidance across several standards and Notes relating to real-time communication and XR, it is this level of complexity that this document endeavours to address.

Comments are welcome through **19th November 2021**.

The [Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/) has published a First Public Working Draft of [Natural Language Interface Accessibility User Requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/WD-naur-20211012/). This document outlines various accessibility-related user needs, requirements and scenarios for natural language interfaces. These user needs should influence accessibility requirements in various related specifications, as well as the design of applications that include natural language interfaces including speech and voice input. The document discusses where work is needed in behind the scenes services, to support accessibility and user needs and associated requirements are then described.

Comments are welcome through **12th November 2021**.

<a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/03/media-production-workshop/" class="imageLink"><img src="https://www.w3.org/2021/03/media-production-workshop/media/timeline-thin-sm.jpg" alt="Timeline photo by Jacob Miller on Unsplash" height="80" /></a>W3C announced today the [joint W3C/SMPTE Workshop on Professional Media Production on the Web](https://www.w3.org/2021/03/media-production-workshop), which is being organized as a virtual event during SMPTE’s annual ATC event, 9-18 November 2021.

Professional media assets, including audio-visual masters for television and motion pictures, are increasingly being stored in the cloud. The workshop will connect the web platform and the professional media production communities and explore evolutions of the Web platform to address professional media production requirements, including:

- Using Web technologies, like WebCodecs, WebGPU, and Web Audio for professional media production
- Understand the unique performance and format requirements of professional media production workflows
- Identify gaps in the web platform and standardization opportunities

This joint W3C/SMPTE event will be organized as a combination of pre-recorded talks followed by online discussions on GitHub, and culminating in a series of live sessions in November 2021.

Interested parties are encouraged to [submit a proposal for a talk](https://www.w3.org/2021/03/media-production-workshop/speakers.html) as soon as possible. Deadline for selected speakers to provide their recorded talks is **15 October 2021**.

Workshop organizers are also interested in expanding diversity of the program committee to cover other perspectives and regional specificities. Please reach out to François Daoust &lt;<fd@w3.org>&gt; if you are interested.

The event is free and open to anyone with relevant perspectives on the topic, whether or not W3C/SMPTE members. Please [register](https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/1/media-production-ws-2021/) by **5 November 2021** to be notified of talks availability, of the forum set up to facilitate discussion among registered participants, and of the live sessions logistics. To make sure that live interactions can take place during live sessions, the Program Committee may restrict participation to live sessions based on information provided during registration.
