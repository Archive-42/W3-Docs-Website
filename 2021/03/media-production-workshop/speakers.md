Who should apply to speak at the workshop?
------------------------------------------

W3C is convening this virtual workshop, organized jointly with SMPTE, to build a shared understanding of how professional media production scenarios intersect with Web technologies and help chart the Web platform's standardization roadmap in that space.

How to apply to speak?
----------------------

If your experience or expertise in the field has provided you with insights (questions or answers) about this intersection, in particular about the [topics in scope of the workshop](./#topics), please [submit a proposal using the **submit a talk proposal** form](#submit-form) **as soon as possible** and we will work with you in confirming and defining your proposed contribution. You may also [contact the Program Committee directly](mailto:group-media-production-pc@w3.org) at any time if you have questions.

Why should I apply to speak?
----------------------------

Your audience, the workshop participants, will include representatives from the professional media production ecosystem, browser vendors, media production tool vendors, media content providers, standards organizations representatives.

Web browsers are the most widely deployed platform, reaching more than 4 billion users across devices, and provides a key stepping stone to deploy tools at scale.

Bringing your perspective to this workshop provides a unique opportunity to have a wide-scale and lasting impact on the future of media production.

This will also help you establish contacts with new communities and new experts, expanding your network of experts and business relations.

Beyond the workshop itself, the record of the presentations will be available on the W3C site as part of the event record, and will serve as a point of reference and discussion for the years to come.

What should my talk cover?
--------------------------

The Program Committee will review proposed talks to assess whether they fit well with the call for participation, in particular the list of [identified topics](./#topics).

Once selected, speakers should aim to provide a talk that:

-   brings their specific perspective on the topic,
-   identifies what barriers may need to be lifted to make browsers a great platform for professional media production scenarios, in particular those where **interoperability and standardization** are likely to play a role,
-   sheds light on specific aspects or questions that the Program Committee may have raised during their review process,
-   raises questions of their own that other Workshop participants may usefully provide input on.

Talks are expected to be in the 5 to 10 minutes time range, to ensure that as many workshop participants as possible can watch the submitted talks prior to the live discussions.

How will talks be recorded and presented?
-----------------------------------------

Once approved by the Program Committee, talks are expected to be delivered as a combination of a slideset (in HTML or PDF) and a recorded audio or video of the speaker (**without** screen recording of the slides) **before 15 October 2021**.

These two elements will then be synchronized and combined to allow Workshop participants to watch presentations at their own pace - see [an example of this synchronized presentation viewer](https://www.w3.org/2020/06/machine-learning-workshop/talks/web_platform_a_30_000_feet_view_web_platform_and_js_environment_constraints.html) for a previous W3C event.

You can find W3C [guidance on tools and tips](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Virtual_Presentations) to record yourself. As an alternative, the Program Committee will offer to record speakers over a teleconferencing system (e.g. Zoom) both to help with technical matters and to provide an audience to the speaker, since we recognize that speaking alone in front of a camera is not necessarily an easy exercise.

W3C also provides [more general guidance on how to present effectively](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Speaker_Resources) and [in a way accessible to people with disabilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/training/accessible.php#during).

Talks are expected to be delivered in English. Please [contact the Program Committee](mailto:group-media-production-pc@w3.org) if you would like to submit a talk in another language.

W3C will provide transcripts and captions for all the selected presentations and will ask speakers' help in reviewing these for accuracy.

What other commitments are expected from me if I give a talk?
-------------------------------------------------------------

A few weeks after all the pre-recorded talks have been published on the W3C site, the Program Committee will set up a series of teleconferences where each of the workshop topics will get discussed, as informed by the submitted presentations.

Speakers are expected to the best of their availability to be on the call(s) where the topic of their presentation is being discussed, to answer and raise questions with other workshop participants.

The Program Committee will also set up asynchronous communication mechanisms (forum, slack) where speakers are cordially invited to participate to exchange with other speakers and workshop participants.
