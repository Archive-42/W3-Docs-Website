## 18–22 October: Breakout sessions, social events

### Breakout sessions

This is an opportunity for everyone to propose, choose, and participate in breakout sessions on a wide variety of topics relating to W3C activities. It is a chance to contribute to discussions and connect with people working on ideas that may not fall within your usual areas of activity.

Sessions are expected to operate under W3C's [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/) and to produce a public record of their discussions. Even while outside chartered W3C groups, participants should be aware of [W3C policies](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/ipr-notice-20021231).

This year again, we plan to offer a set of breakout discussions open to the broader public, toward the goal of bringing more diverse voices into the W3C community.

**[The breakout sessions schedule is now available](https://eur.cvent.me/d10rG)**

### Social events

Join the [live sessions](https://eur.cvent.me/d10rG) to clear your mind and get ready for engaging and stimulating discussions:

- Live cooking: Wednesday 20 October 17:00-17:30 UTC
