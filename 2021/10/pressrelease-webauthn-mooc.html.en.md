[https://www.w3.org/](/), and <https://www.yubico.com> — 14 October 2021 — Amid growing need around the world to modernize authentication and address phishing and credential theft, W3C and Yubico announced today the opening of registration for a W3Cx online education course that teaches developers how to build and incorporate modern authentication techniques into their web-based applications using W3C’s Web Authentication (WebAuthn).

W3C and Yubico collaborated to design the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) titled “[Introduction to Web Authentication](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-web-authentication)” to equip learners with the knowledge to replace aging password-based credentials with a secure model that incorporates strong authentication. The course begins 30 November 2021 and is free to learners who can opt-into a paid course and earn a certificate of completion.

“*Yubico is happy to team up with W3C on this MOOC course,*” said Stina Ehrensvard, CEO and co-founder of Yubico. “*On our joint mission to make the internet safer for all, an important step is to educate developers on modern authentication standards and tools.*”

The three-week online course introduces developers to the principles of Web Authentication, from the development of the Application Programming Interface (API), to the terminology and the technical know-how. The heart of the course teaches students how to build and deploy their own Web Authentication server.

### Course aimed at raising awareness, boosting adoption

One of the pillars of the Web Authentication API is its design to eliminate phishing by using public key-based credentials to protect log-ins and access to Web resources. Credentials represent the most common initial attack target, and compromised credentials represent 20% of breaches at an average cost of $4.37 million per breach, according to [IBM’s 2021 Breach Report](https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach).

“*WebAuthn will change the way people access resources on the web,*” said W3C CEO Jeff Jaffe. “*With multi-factor solutions that eliminate a weak link, Web services and businesses adopt WebAuthn to move beyond vulnerable passwords and improve the security of online experiences. I am looking forward to more web developers becoming experts thanks to this course and implementing the web-wide interoperability guidance of the standard.*”

The W3C’s Web Authentication Working Group [advanced to W3C Recommendation in 2019](https://www.w3.org/2019/03/pressrelease-webauthn-rec.html.en) the specification “Web Authentication: An API for Accessing Public Key Credentials Level 1”. The group completed a second Recommendation version in 2021, and is currently working on a third update. A W3C Recommendation is an official web standard.

The “Introduction to Web Authentication” course is the seventh online course available on W3Cx, W3C’s online learning platform on edX. Since the initial HTML5 online course launched in 2015, over 1.3M students from around the world have enrolled in a W3Cx course.
