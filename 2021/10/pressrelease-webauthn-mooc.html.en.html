      October 2021 &#8212; Amid growing need around the world to modernize
      authentication and address phishing and credential theft, W3C and Yubico
      announced today the opening of registration for a W3Cx online education
      course that teaches developers how to build and incorporate modern
      authentication techniques into their web-based applications using W3C’s
      Web Authentication (WebAuthn).
    </p>
    <p>
      W3C and Yubico collaborated to design the Massive Open Online Course
      (MOOC) titled “<a
        href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-web-authentication"
        >Introduction to Web Authentication</a
      >” to equip learners with the knowledge to replace aging password-based
      credentials with a secure model that incorporates strong authentication.
      The course begins 30 November 2021 and is free to learners who can
      opt-into a paid course and earn a certificate of completion.
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Yubico is happy to team up with W3C on this MOOC course,</i>” said
      Stina Ehrensvard, CEO and co-founder of Yubico. “<i
        >On our joint mission to make the internet safer for all, an important
        step is to educate developers on modern authentication standards and
        tools.</i
      >”
    </p>
    <p>
      The three-week online course introduces developers to the principles of
      Web Authentication, from the development of the Application Programming
      Interface (API), to the terminology and the technical know-how. The heart
      of the course teaches students how to build and deploy their own Web
      Authentication server.
    </p>
    <h3>Course aimed at raising awareness, boosting adoption</h3>
    <p>
      One of the pillars of the Web Authentication API is its design to
      eliminate phishing by using public key-based credentials to protect
      log-ins and access to Web resources. Credentials represent the most common
      initial attack target, and compromised credentials represent 20% of
      breaches at an average cost of $4.37 million per breach, according to
      <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach"
        >IBM’s 2021 Breach Report</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>WebAuthn will change the way people access resources on the web,</i>”
      said W3C CEO Jeff Jaffe. “<i
        >With multi-factor solutions that eliminate a weak link, Web services
        and businesses adopt WebAuthn to move beyond vulnerable passwords and
        improve the security of online experiences. I am looking forward to more
        web developers becoming experts thanks to this course and implementing
        the web-wide interoperability guidance of the standard.</i
      >”
    </p>
    <p>
      The W3C’s Web Authentication Working Group
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/03/pressrelease-webauthn-rec.html.en"
        >advanced to W3C Recommendation in 2019</a
      >
      the specification “Web Authentication: An API for Accessing Public Key
      Credentials Level 1”. The group completed a second Recommendation version
      in 2021, and is currently working on a third update. A W3C Recommendation
      is an official web standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The “Introduction to Web Authentication” course is the seventh online
      course available on W3Cx, W3C’s online learning platform on edX. Since the
      initial HTML5 online course launched in 2015, over 1.3M students from
      around the world have enrolled in a W3Cx course.
