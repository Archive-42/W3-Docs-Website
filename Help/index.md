Do you need help on the W3C Website?
------------------------------------

-   If you encounter technical problems, please refer to our [FAQ about the W3C Website](/Help/Webmaster.html).
-   If you have comments on the W3C Website, let us know by sending a message to <site-comments@w3.org> with the URI (that is, the Web address) of the page(s) in question. That is a [publicly archived](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/site-comments/) mailing list.
-   If you have questions about the authentication systems in use on W3C's site please see [Which authentication systems does W3C use on its site?](/Help/Webmaster.html#authentication)

What does W3C do?
-----------------

W3C's primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web. W3C's standards define key parts of what makes the World Wide Web work. Learn more about [W3C's mission.](/Consortium/mission)

Where is W3C located?
---------------------

W3C does not have a single physical headquarters. There are four institutions that "host" W3C: MIT (in Cambridge, MA, USA), ERCIM (in Sophia-Antipolis, France), Keio University (near Tokyo, Japan), and Beihang University (in Beijing, China).

The [W3C staff](/People/) is distributed around the world, but there are concentrations of people in Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA), Sophia-Antipolis (France), Tokyo (Japan) and Beijing (China). In addition, W3C is represented by [W3C Evangelists](/Consortium/evangelists/) or [W3C Chapters](https://chapters.w3.org/directory/) in various locations.

How is W3C funded?
------------------

W3C receives funds from:

-   [W3C Member dues](/Consortium/fees)
-   [Research grants and other sources of private and public funding](/Consortium/nmfunds)
-   [Individual donations of money and equipment](/Consortium/sup)

What is the difference between the Web and the Internet?
--------------------------------------------------------

From the [definition in the Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet): "The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that interchange data by packet switching using the standardized Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)."

Thus, the Internet is a network of networks, defined by the TPC/IP standards.

The Web, on the other hand, is defined in W3C's [Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume I](/TR/webarch/) as follows: "The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)."

Thus, the Web is an information space. The first three specifications for Web technologies defined URLs, HTTP, and HTML.

What does it mean that Tim Berners-Lee invented the Web?
--------------------------------------------------------

[Tim Berners-Lee](/People/Berners-Lee/) wrote a [proposal](http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html) in 1989 for a system called the World Wide Web. He then wrote the first Web browser, server, and Web page. He wrote the first specifications for URLs, HTTP, and HTML.

W3C has a validation service. Does W3C approve all Web pages?
-------------------------------------------------------------

No. W3C does provide a [free service for validating Web pages against standard formats](http://validator.w3.org/unicorn/). Although validation is not mandatory on the Web, it is useful for improving the quality of pages.

What is the difference between an open standard and open source software?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general terms: open source refers to software, and open standards refer to documents (that may then be implemented by software). There is no single definition global for either term.

Some elements of openness that apply to W3C standards include:

-   All standards are available publicly at no cost
-   W3C adopted a [Patent Policy](/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) in 2004 with the stated goal of assuring "that Recommendations produced under this policy can be implemented on a Royalty-Free (RF) basis."
-   [W3C Process](/Consortium/Process/) requires that groups address public comments
-   All technical comments are handled on their merits, whether they are made by W3C Members or public.
-   W3C's process is vendor-neutral.
-   W3C's [persistence policy](/Consortium/Persistence) seeks to ensure that standards will be available at the same URI, unchanged, indefinitely.

Does W3C design Web sites? Can you recommend a designer?
--------------------------------------------------------

W3C is not in the business of designing Web sites. Although we greatly appreciate that many designers promote standards-based Web design, at the current time for reasons of neutrality, we cannot officially recommend any particular designers.

Do you have more FAQs?
----------------------

Yes. These additional FAQs are maintained by various people in the community; some are more up-to-date than others.
