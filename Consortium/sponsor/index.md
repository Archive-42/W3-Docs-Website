Ensuring that the Web remains open, accessible and interoperable for everyone around the world is a mission that the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) takes to heart every day. While some of the technical work we do receives funding from [Member organizations](/Consortium/membership), we are only able to achieve Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee’s vision of leading the Web to its full potential through the generosity of contributions and sponsorships from individuals and organizations.

Donations
---------

Since 1994, W3C has been developing Web Quality tools used every day by millions of Web developers and Web designers. These tools are *free*, *Open-Source* and provide the Web a fair, reliable help in building Web content that works now and will work in the future. Good tools cost a lot to develop, support, host and maintain: with your help, we can make the validators better, faster, friendlier, and maintain a great, free service for all of the Web.  
  
W3C invites donations from the Web community to help support its operations of stewardship in leading the Web to its full potential. Our strong commitment to those who make the Web work feeds the virtuous circle of *increasing developer engagement at W3C* and the value of W3C to the community. Day after day, the W3C Team does its best to make the Web a better place and help you build the Web.  
  
**Support W3C's mission and its free services, become a *Friend of the W3C*, [donate](/support)**.
