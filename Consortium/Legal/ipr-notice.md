W3C has established a framework of policies, terms and conditions that govern your interaction with the Web site and with the documents and services W3C provides. Please see below for **W3C's Intellectual Rights Notices and Legal Disclaimers**.

## <span id="Copyright">Copyrights</span> for Documents, Software, Tests

W3C offers several licenses depending on the nature of the material, and whether derivative works are permitted.

- The [Document License](/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents) governs documents such as technical reports. See also the [policy for relicensing unfinished W3C specifications](/2014/12/relicense.html)
- The [Software License](/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software) governs distribution of W3C [W3C Open Source Software](/Status.html) and some other materials where creation of derivative works may be desired.
- The [Test Suite Licenses](/Consortium/Legal/2008/04-testsuite-copyright.html) governs the distribution of W3C test suites. There are two licenses, depending on whether you plan to modify the test cases. W3C encourages people to contribute to W3C test suites; contributors agree to the [Test Case Contribution Policy](/2004/10/27-testcases.html).
- In [Community and Business Groups](/community/), draft Specifications are governed by a [W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/). Participants then sign (voluntarily) a [Final Specification Agreement](http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/final/). These agreements include both copyright and patent licensing provisions.

See also information about [translations of the copyright notice](/Consortium/Legal/2006/08-copyright-translations.html).

## Trademarks

W3C [trademarks](/Consortium/Legal/2002/trademarks-20021231) and [logos](/participate/promote#logos) are governed by the [trademark license](/Consortium/Legal/2002/trademark-license-20021231). There are also some additional usage policies for some logos, such as the [W3C logo usage policies](/Consortium/Legal/logo-usage-20000308).

## Patent Policy

In February 2004, W3C adopted a [Patent Policy](/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) to enable continued innovation and widespread adoption of Web standards developed by the World Wide Web Consortium. The W3C Patent Policy governs the handling of patents in the process of producing [Web Standards](/standards/). The goal of this policy is to assure that Recommendations produced under this policy can be implemented on a [Royalty-Free (RF) basis](/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#sec-Requirements). See the [Patent Policy FAQ](/2003/12/22-pp-faq) for additional information.

## Antitrust and Competition Guidance
