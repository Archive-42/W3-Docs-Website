- Membership

Organizations join W3C to drive the direction of core Web technology and exchange ideas with industry and research leaders. Members can find additional information on the [Member site](/Member/) (Member-only).

W3C Standards are royalty-free to implement and do not require W3C Membership to use. If your organization has specific requirements you'd like to see addressed by Web Standards, then joining W3C and being active in the work is the best way to achieve that.
