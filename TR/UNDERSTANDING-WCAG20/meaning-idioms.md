(Level AAA)

Intent of this Success Criterion
--------------------------------

Certain disabilities make it difficult to understand nonliteral word usage and specialized words or usage. Certain disabilities make it difficult to understand figurative language or specialized usage. Providing such mechanisms is vital for these audiences. Specialized information intended for non-specialist readers is encouraged to satisfy this Success Criterion, even when claiming only Single-A or Double-A conformance.

### Specific Benefits of Success Criterion 3.1.3:

This Success Criterion may help people with cognitive, language and learning disabilities who:

-   have difficulty decoding words

-   have difficulty understanding words and phrases

-   have difficulty using context to aid understanding

It would also help people with visual disabilities who:

-   lose context when zoomed-in with a screen magnifier

Examples of Success Criterion 3.1.3
-----------------------------------

-   **Text that includes a definition for a word used in an unusual way.**

    Organize the list or "cascade" of dictionaries and other resources so that the definition search will find the intended definitions instead of displaying definitions from other sources in the "cascade." (The "cascade" lists the dictionaries and other reference materials in the order most likely to bring up the right definition. This controls the order to follow when searching for definitions.)

-   **Including definitions in the glossary.**

    WCAG 2.0 uses the word "text" in a specific way. Thus, when the word "text" is used within WCAG 2.0 it is linked to the definition of "text" provided in a glossary within the same Web page.

-   **The specific definition of a word is provided at the bottom of the page.**

    The internal link from the word to the corresponding definition is also provided within the page.

Techniques and Failures for Success Criterion 3.1.3 - Unusual Words
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Each numbered item in this section represents a technique or combination of techniques that the WCAG Working Group deems sufficient for meeting this Success Criterion. However, it is not necessary to use these particular techniques. For information on using other techniques, see [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20-20161007/understanding-techniques.html), particularly the "Other Techniques" section.

### Additional Techniques (Advisory) for 3.1.3

Although not required for conformance, the following additional techniques should be considered in order to make content more accessible. Not all techniques can be used or would be effective in all situations.

-   Using markup and visual formatting to help users recognize words that have special meaning (future link)

-   Providing a voice-enabled dictionary search so that users who have difficulty typing or spelling can speak the word whose definition they need (future link)

-   Providing a sign language dictionary to help users who are deaf find the necessary definitions (future link)

-   Providing a mechanism for finding definitions for all words in text content (future link)

-   Providing a mechanism to determine the meaning of each word or phrase in text content (future link)

-   Avoiding unusual foreign words (future link)

-   Using a series of dictionaries in cascading fashion to provide meanings (future link)

### Common Failures for SC 3.1.3

The following are common mistakes that are considered failures of Success Criterion 3.1.3 by the WCAG Working Group.

(No failures currently documented)

Key Terms
---------

 <span id="idiomsdef"></span> idiom  
phrase whose meaning cannot be deduced from the meaning of the individual words and the specific words cannot be changed without losing the meaning

*Note:* idioms cannot be translated directly, word for word, without losing their (cultural or language-dependent) meaning.

*Example 1:* In English, "spilling the beans" means "revealing a secret." However, "knocking over the beans" or "spilling the vegetables" does not mean the same thing.

*Example 2:* In Japanese, the phrase "<span lang="jp" lang="jp">さじを投げる</span>" literally translates into "he throws a spoon," but it means that there is nothing he can do and finally he gives up.

*Example 3:* In Dutch, "<span lang="ne" lang="ne">Hij ging met de kippen op stok</span>" literally translates into "He went to roost with the chickens," but it means that he went to bed early.

 <span id="jargondef"></span> jargon  
words used in a particular way by people in a particular field

*Example:* The word StickyKeys is jargon from the field of assistive technology/accessibility.

 <span id="mechanismdef"></span> mechanism  
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#processdef" class="termref">process</a> or technique for achieving a result

*Note 1:* The mechanism may be explicitly provided in the content, or may be <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#reliedupondef" class="termref">relied upon</a> to be provided by either the platform or by <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#useragentdef" class="termref">user agents</a>, including <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#atdef" class="termref">assistive technologies</a>.

*Note 2:* The mechanism needs to meet all success criteria for the conformance level claimed.

 <span id="unusual-restricteddef"></span> used in an unusual or restricted way  
words used in such a way that requires users to know exactly which definition to apply in order to understand the content correctly

*Example:* The term "gig" means something different if it occurs in a discussion of music concerts than it does in article about computer hard drive space, but the appropriate definition can be determined from context. By contrast, the word "text" is used in a very specific way in WCAG 2.0, so a definition is supplied in the glossary.
