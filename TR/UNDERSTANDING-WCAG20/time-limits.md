<span id="time-limits"></span> **Enough Time**<span class="screenreader">:</span> Understanding Guideline 2.2
=============================================================================================================

> **Guideline 2.2:** Provide users enough time to read and use content.

<span id="time-limits-intent"></span> Intent of Guideline 2.2
-------------------------------------------------------------

Many users who have disabilities need more time to complete tasks than the majority of users: they may take longer to physically respond, they may take longer to read things, they may have low vision and take longer to find things or to read them, or they may be accessing content through an assistive technology that requires more time. This guideline focuses on ensuring that users are able to complete the tasks required by the content with their own individual response times. The primary approaches deal with eliminating time constraints or providing users enough additional time to allow them to complete their tasks. Exceptions are provided for those cases where this is not possible.
