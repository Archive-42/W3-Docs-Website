            graphically displaying a sequence of snapshots within the same

        <p>
          Implementing APIs that are independent of a particular operating
          environment (as are the W3C DOM Level 2 specifications) may reduce
          implementation costs for multi-platform user agents and promote the
          development of multi-platform assistive technologies. Implementing
          conventional APIs for a particular operating environment may reduce
          implementation costs for assistive technology developers who wish to
          interoperate with more than one piece of software running on that
          operating environment.

          A "device <acronym>API</acronym>" defines how communication may take
          place with an input or output device such as a keyboard, mouse, or
          video card.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this document, an "input/output <acronym>API</acronym>" defines how
          applications or devices communicate with a user agent. As used in this
          document, input and output APIs include, but are not limited to,
          device APIs. Input and output APIs also include more abstract
          communication interfaces than those specified by device APIs. A
          "conventional input/output API" is one that is expected to be
          implemented by software running on a particular operating environment.
          For example, the conventional input <acronym>APIs</acronym> of the
          <a href="intro.html#target">target user agent</a> are for the mouse
          and keyboard. For touch screen devices or mobile devices, conventional
          input <acronym>APIs</acronym> may include stylus, buttons, and voice.
          The graphical display and sound card are considered conventional
          output devices for a graphical desktop computer environment, and each
          has an associated <acronym>API</acronym>.

          but not for the <code>title</code> attribute. The HTML 4 specification
          does indicate that the <code>title</code> attribute should be
          available to users through the user interface ("Values of the title
          attribute may be rendered by user agents in a variety of ways...").

        In the context of this document, the verbs "to control" and "to
        configure" share in common the idea of governance such as a user may
        exercise over interface layout, user agent behavior, rendering style,
        and other parameters required by this document. Generally, the
        difference in the terms centers on the idea of <em>persistence</em>.
        When a user makes a change by "controlling" a setting, that change
        usually does not persist beyond that user session. On the other hand,
        when a user "configures" a setting, that setting typically persists into
        later user sessions. Furthermore, the term "control" typically means
        that the change can be made easily (such as through a keyboard shortcut)
        and that the results of the change occur immediately. The term
        "configure" typically means that making the change requires more time
        and effort (such as making the change via a series of menus leading to a
        dialog box, or via style sheets or scripts). The results of
        "configuration" might not take effect immediately (e.g., due to time
        spent reinitializing the system, initiating a new session, or rebooting
        the system).
        <p>
          In order to be able to configure and control the user agent, the user
          needs to be able to "write" as well as "read" values for these
          parameters. Configuration settings may be stored in a

            title="Definition of Profile"
            >profile</a
          >. The range and granularity of the changes that can be controlled or
          configured by the user may depend on limitations of the

            with focus set and unset

            Once it has been set, it may be used to trigger other behaviors
            associated with the enabled element (e.g., the user may activate a
            link or change the state of a form control). These behaviors may be
            triggered programmatically or through the user interface (e.g.,
            through keyboard events).

        <p>
          User interface mechanisms may resemble content focus, but do not
          satisfy all of the properties. For example, designers of word
          processing software often implement a "caret" that indicates the
          current location of text input or editing. The caret may have state
          and may respond to input device events, but it does not enable users
          to activate the behaviors associated with enabled elements.

        <p>
          The user interface focus shares the properties of the content focus

        A user agent renders a document by applying formatting algorithms and
        style information to the document's elements. Formatting depends on a
        number of factors, including where the document is rendered: on screen,
        on paper, through loudspeakers, on a braille display, or on a mobile
        device. Style information (e.g., fonts, colors, and synthesized speech
        prosody) may come from the elements themselves (e.g., certain font and
        phrase elements in HTML), from style sheets, or from user agent
        settings. For the purposes of these guidelines, each formatting or style
        option is governed by a property and each property may take one value
        from a set of legal values. Generally in this document, the term "<a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/conform.html"

        Authors encode information in many ways, including in markup languages,
        style sheet languages, scripting languages, and protocols. When the
        information is encoded in a manner that allows the user agent to process
        it with certainty, the user agent can "recognize" the information. For
        instance, HTML allows authors to specify a heading with the
        <code>H1</code>
        element, so a user agent that implements HTML can recognize that content
        as a heading. If the author creates a heading using a visual effect
        alone (e.g., just by increasing the font size), then the author has
        encoded the heading in a manner that does not allow the user agent to
        recognize it as a heading.

        In this document, the expression "serial access" refers to
        <a href="#viewport-dimension">one-dimensional</a> access to rendered
        content. Some examples of serial access include listening to an audio
        stream or watching a video (both of which involve one temporal
        dimension), or reading a series of lines of braille one line at a time
        (one spatial dimension). Many users with blindness have serial access to
        content rendered as audio, synthesized speech, or lines of braille.
        <p>
          The expression "sequential navigation" refers to navigation through an
          ordered set of items (e.g., the
          <a
            class="dfn-instance"
            href="#def-enabled-element"
            rel="glossary"
            title="Definition of Enabled element"
            >enabled elements</a
          >
          in a document, a sequence of lines or pages, or a sequence of menu
          options). Sequential navigation implies that the user cannot skip
          directly from one member of the set to another, in contrast to direct
          or structured navigation (see
          <a href="guidelines.html#gl-navigation" class="noxref">guideline 9</a>
          for information about these types of navigation). Users with blindness
          or some users with a physical disability may navigate content
          sequentially (e.g., by navigating through links, one by one, in a
          graphical viewport with or without the aid of an assistive
          technology). Sequential navigation is important to users who cannot
          scan rendered content visually for context and also benefits users
          unfamiliar with content. The increments of sequential navigation may
          be determined by a number of factors, including element type (e.g.,
          links only), content structure (e.g., navigation from heading to
          heading), and the current navigation context (e.g., having navigated
          to a table, allow navigation among the table cells).
        </p>
        <p>
          Users with serial access to content or who navigate sequentially may
          require more time to access content than users who use direct or
          structured navigation.

        general classes of objects, such as "images" or "Japanese." A user agent

        content developers, the requirement to synchronize means to provide the
        data that will permit sensible time-coordinated rendering by a user
        agent. For example, Web content developers can ensure that the segments
        of caption text are neither too long nor too short, and that they map to
        segments of the visual track that are appropriate in length. For user
        agent developers, the requirement to synchronize means to present the
        content in a sensible time-coordinated fashion under a wide range of
        circumstances including technology constraints (e.g., small text-only
        displays), user limitations (slow reading speeds, large font sizes, high
        need for review or repeat functions), and content that is sub-optimal in
        terms of accessibility.

        and in this document, text elements are presumed to produce text that
        can be understood when rendered visually, as synthesized speech, or as
        Braille. Such text elements benefit at least these three groups of
        users:
        <ol>
          <li>
            visually-displayed text benefits users who are deaf and adept in
            reading visually-displayed text;
          </li>
          <li>
            synthesized speech benefits users who are blind and adept in use of
            synthesized speech;
          </li>
          <li>
            braille benefits users who are blind, and possibly deaf-blind, and
            adept at reading braille.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          A text element may consist of both text and non-text data. For
          instance, a text element may contain markup for style (e.g., font size
          or color), structure (e.g., heading levels), and other semantics. The
          essential function of the text element should be retained even if
          style information happens to be lost in rendering.
        </p>
        <p>
          A user agent may have to process a text element in order to have
          access to the text characters. For instance, a text element may
          consist of markup, it may be encrypted or compressed, or it may
          include embedded text in a binary format (e.g.,
          <acronym>JPEG</acronym>).

          The term "user interface control" refers to a component of the user
          agent user interface or the content user interface, distinguished
          where necessary.

        through one or more viewports. Viewports include windows, frames, pieces
        of paper, loudspeakers, and virtual magnifying glasses. A viewport may
        contain another viewport (e.g., nested frames).

          Graphical and tactile viewports have two spatial
          <strong
            ><a name="viewport-dimension" id="viewport-dimension"
              >dimensions</a
            ></strong
          >. A viewport may also have temporal dimensions, for instance when
          audio, speech, animations, and movies are rendered. When the
          dimensions (spatial or temporal) of rendered content exceed the
          dimensions of the viewport, the user agent provides mechanisms such as
          scroll bars and advance and rewind controls so that the user can
          access the rendered content "outside" the viewport. Examples include:
          when the user can only view a portion of a large document through a
          small graphical viewport, or when audio content has already been
          played.
        </p>
        <p>
          When several viewports coexist, only one has the
          <a
            class="dfn-instance"

            >current focus</a
          >
          at a given moment. This viewport is

          to make it stand out.
        </p>
        <p>
          User agents may render the same content in a variety of ways; each
          rendering is called a <em>view</em>. For instance, a user agent may
          allow users to view an entire document or just a list of the
          document's headers. These are two different views of the document.
