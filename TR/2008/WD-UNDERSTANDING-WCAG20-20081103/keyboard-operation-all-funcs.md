=====================================================================================================================================

> **[2.1.3](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/PR-WCAG20-20081103/#keyboard-operation-all-funcs) Keyboard (No Exception):** All <a href="#functiondef" class="termref">functionality</a> of the content is operable through a <a href="#keybrd-interfacedef" class="termref">keyboard interface</a> without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes. (Level AAA)

Intent of this Success Criterion
--------------------------------

The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that **all** content is operable from the keyboard. This is the same as Success Criterion 2.1.1, except that no exceptions are allowed. This does not mean that content where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints (excluded from the requirements of 2.1.1) must be made keyboard accessible. Rather, it means that content that uses analog, time-dependent input cannot conform to this Success Criterion and therefore cannot meet Guideline 2.1 at Level AAA.

Techniques and Failures for Success Criterion 2.1.3 - Keyboard (No Exception)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each numbered item in this section represents a technique or combination of techniques that the WCAG Working Group deems sufficient for meeting this Success Criterion. The techniques listed only satisfy the Success Criterion if all of the [WCAG 2.0 conformance requirements](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/PR-WCAG20-20081103/#conformance-reqs) have been met.

### Sufficient Techniques

1.  No additional techniques exist for this Success Criterion. Follow [techniques for Success Criterion 2.1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20-20081103/keyboard-operation-keyboard-operable.html#keyboard-operation-keyboard-operable-techniques-head) . If that is not possible because there is a requirement for analog, time-dependent input, then it is not possible to meet this Level AAA Success Criterion.

Key Terms
---------

 <span id="functiondef"></span> functionality  
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/PR-WCAG20-20081103/#processdef" class="termref">processes</a> and outcomes achievable through user action

 <span id="keybrd-interfacedef"></span> keyboard interface  
interface used by software to obtain keystroke input

Note 1: A keyboard interface allows users to provide keystroke input to programs even if the native technology does not contain a keyboard.

Example: A touchscreen PDA has a keyboard interface built into its operating system as well as a connector for external keyboards. Applications on the PDA can use the interface to obtain keyboard input either from an external keyboard or from other applications that provide simulated keyboard output, such as handwriting interpreters or speech-to-text applications with "keyboard emulation" functionality.

Note 2: Operation of the application (or parts of the application) through a keyboard-operated mouse emulator, such as MouseKeys, does not qualify as operation through a keyboard interface because operation of the program is through its pointing device interface, not through its keyboard interface.
