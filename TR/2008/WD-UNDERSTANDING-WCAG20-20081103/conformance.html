        <p>
          All WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria are written as testable criteria for
          objectively determining if content satisfies them. Testing the Success
          Criteria would involve a combination of automated testing and human
          evaluation. The content should be tested by those who understand how
          people with different types of disabilities use the Web.
        </p>
        <p>
          Testing and testable in the context refer to functional testing, that
          is verifying that the content functions as expected, or in this case,
          that it satisfies the Success Criteria. Although content may satisfy
          all Success Criteria, the content may not always be usable by people
          with a wide variety of disabilities. Therefore, usability testing is
          recommended, in addition to the required functional testing. Usability
          testing aims to determine how well people can use the content for its
          intended purpose. It is recommended that users with disabilities be
          included in test groups when performing usability testing.

            What does conformance mean?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Conformance to a standard means that you meet or satisfy the
            'requirements' of the standard. In WCAG 2.0 the 'requirements' are
            the Success Criteria. To conform to WCAG 2.0, you need to satisfy
            the Success Criteria , that is, there is no content which violates
            the Success Criteria..
          </p>
          <div class="note">
            <p class="prefix">
              Note: This means that if there is no content to which a success
              criterion applies, the success criterion is satisfied.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Most standards only have one level of conformance. In order to
            accommodate different situations that may require or allow greater
            levels of accessibility than others, WCAG 2.0 has three levels of
            conformance, and therefore, three levels of Success Criteria.

            There are five requirements that must be met in order for content to
            be classified as 'conforming' to WCAG 2.0. This section provides
            brief notes on those requirements. This section will be expanded
            over time to address questions that may arise or to provide new
            examples of ways to meet the different conformance requirements.

            The first requirement deals with the levels of conformance. It
            basically says that all information on a page conforms or has a
            <a
              href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/PR-WCAG20-20081103/#conforming-alternate-versiondef"
              >conforming alternate version</a
            >
            that is available from the page. The requirement also explains that
            no conformance is possible without at least satisfying all of the
            Level A Success Criteria.
          </p>
          <p>
            The note points out that authors are encouraged to go beyond
            conformance to a particular level and to complete, and report if
            they desire, any progress toward higher levels of conformance.

            can jump to from the page with the graphic. This makes it clear that
            such content is considered part of the Web page, so that requirement

            There are four provisions that particularly deal with issues of

            here. A note on each of the provisions indicates that these Success

            using technologies that are not accessibility supported.

              Example: A Web page incorporates a new interactive graphic
              technology called "ZAP". Although ZAP is accessibility-supported,
              the information that is presented in ZAP is also presented on the
              page in HTML, so ZAP is not relied upon. So, this page would pass
              conformance requirement #1. However, if the user tries to tab
              through the ZAP content, the focus drops into the ZAP object and
              gets stuck there. Once inside, there is nothing the user can do to
              get the focus back out. So keyboard users cannot use the bottom
              half of the page. The ZAP content also is continually flashing
              brightly at different rates and doesn't stop. So, people with
              attention deficit are distracted and those with photosensitive
              seizure disorders may have seizures. Conformance requirement #5
              prevents situations like these from being possible on a conforming
              page.

            was created or modified after that date. There are no prohibitions
            in WCAG 2.0 to any of these practices as long as it is clear which

            One of the optional components of a conformance claim is
            "Information about any additional steps taken that go beyond the
            Success Criteria to enhance accessibility." This can include
            additional Success Criteria that have been met, advisory techniques
            that were implemented, information about any additional protocols
            used to aid access for people with particular disabilities or needs,
            etc. Any information that would be useful to people in understanding
            the accessibility of the pages may be included.

            Use of metadata to report conformance claims
          </h3>
          <p>
            The most useful way of attaching conformance claims to content would
            be to do so in standard machine readable form. When this practice is
            widespread, search tools or special user agents will be able to make
            use of this information to find and provide content that is more
            accessible or so the user agents can adjust to the content. There
            are a number of metadata based options under development for making
            claims, and authors and tool developers are encouraged to support
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, metadata can be used to report conformance to
            individual Success Criteria once Level A conformance has been
            achieved.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are also programmatic reporting formats such as
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/earl.php"
              >Evaluation and Report Language (EARL)</a
            >
            that are being developed that could provide machine readable formats
            for detailed conformance information. As the reporting formats are
            formalized and support for them develops, they will be documented
            here.

            First, there are a number of conditions that must be met for a
            Success Criterion to be included at all. These include:
          </p>
          <ol class="enumar">
            <li>
              <p>
                All Success Criteria must be
                <strong
                  >important access issues for people with disabilities</strong
                >
                that address problems beyond the usability problems that might
                be faced by all users. In other words, the access issue must
                cause a proportionately greater problem for people with
                disabilities than it causes people without disabilities in order
                to be considered an accessibility issue (and covered under these
                accessibility guidelines).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                All Success Criteria must also be testable. This is important
                since otherwise it would not be possible to determine whether a
                page met or failed to meet the Success Criteria. The Success
                Criteria can be tested by a combination of machine and human
                evaluation as long as it is possible to determine whether a
                Success Criterion has been satisfied with a high level of
                confidence.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The Success Criteria were assigned to one of the three levels of
            conformance by the working group after taking into consideration a
            wide range of interacting issues. Some of the common factors
            evaluated when setting the level included:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                whether the Success Criterion is <strong>essential</strong> (in
                other words, if the Success Criterion isn't met, then even
                assistive technology can't make content accessible)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                whether it is possible to satisfy the Success Criterion for
                <strong>all Web sites and types of content</strong> that the
                Success Criteria would apply to (e.g. different topics, types of
                content, types of Web technology)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                whether the Success Criterion requires skills that could
                <strong>reasonably be achieved by the content creators</strong>
                (that is, the knowledge and skill to meet the Success Criteria
                could be acquired in a week's training or less)

            Understanding Accessibility Support
          </h2>
          <p>
            Many of the Success Criteria deal with providing accessibility
            through assistive technologies or special accessibility features in
            mainstream user agents (for example, a 'show captions' option in a
            media player). That is, the Success Criteria require that something
            be done in the Web content that would make it possible for assistive
            technologies to successfully present the content's information to
            the user. For example, a picture that you were supposed to click on
            to go to a topic would not be accessible to a person who was blind
            unless text alternatives for the picture were provided in a way that
            user agents including assistive technologies can find and display
            them. The key here is that the text alternative must be included in
            a way that user agents including assistive technologies can
            understand and use – in a way that is "Accessibility Supported."
          </p>
          <p>
            Another example would be a custom control that is included on a Web
            page. In this case, a standard user agent would not ordinarily be
            able to present an alternative to the user. If, however, information
            about the control including its name, role, value, how to set it
            etc. are provided in a way that assistive technologies can
            understand and control them, then users with assistive technologies
            will be able to use these controls.
          </p>
          <p>
            When new technologies are introduced, two things must happen in
            order for people using assistive technologies to be able to access
            them. First, the technologies must be designed in a way that user
            agents including assistive technologies could access all the
            information they need to present the content to the user. Secondly,
            the user agents and assistive technologies may need to be redesigned
            or modified to be able to actually work with these new technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            "<strong>Accessibility Supported</strong>" means that both of these
            have been done and that the technology will work with user agents
            and assistive technologies.

            Level of Assistive Technology Support Needed for "Accessibility
            Support"
          </h3>
          <p>
            This topic raises the question of how many or which assistive
            technologies must support a Web technology in order for that Web
            technology to be considered "accessibility supported". The WCAG
            Working group and the W3C do not specify which or how many assistive
            technologies must support a Web technology in order for it to be
            classified as accessibility supported. This is a complex topic and
            one that varies both by environment and by language. There is a need
            for an external and international dialogue on this topic. Some notes
            to help in understanding and exploring this topic are:

                    In a company where all employees are provided with

                    technologies may need to only be supported by those user

                    There are different levels of older assistive technologies
                    support in different languages and even countries. Some
                    environments or countries may provide free assistive
                    technologies.

                    Clearly, a new technology cannot be supported by all past
                    assistive technologies, so requiring that a technology be
                    supported by all assistive technologies is not possible.

              <p>
                Support for a single older assistive technology is usually not

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Support by just one assistive technology (for a given
                    disability) would not usually be enough, especially if most
                    users who need it in order to access content do not have and
                    cannot afford that assistive technology. The exception here
                    would be information distributed to company employees only
                    where they all have one assistive technology (of that type).

              <p>
                Currently assistive technology that is affordable by the general
                public is often very poor

                    Creating content that can't be used by the general pubic
                    with disabilities should be avoided. In many cases, the cost
                    of assistive technologies is too high for users who need it.
                    Also, the capabilities of free or low cost AT is often so
                    poor today that Web content cannot be realistically
                    restricted to this lowest (or even middle) common
                    denominator. This creates a very difficult dilemma that
                    needs to be addressed.

            The Working Group, therefore, limited itself to defining what
            constituted support and defers the judgment of how much, how many,
            or which AT must support a technology to the community and to
            entities closer to each situation that set requirements for an
            organization, purchase, community, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Working Group encourages more discussion of this topic in the
            general forum of society since this lack of generally available yet
            robust assistive technologies is a problem that affects
            <span>users</span>, technology developers and authors negatively.

            Understanding "Programmatically Determined"
          </h2>
          <p>
            Several Success Criteria require that content (or certain aspects of
            content) can be "programmatically determined." This means that the
            content is authored in such a way that user agents, including
            assistive technologies, can access the information.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order for content created with Web technologies (such as HTML,
            CSS, PDF, GIF, MPEG, Flash etc.) to be accessible to people with
            different types of disabilities, it is essential that the
            technologies used work with the accessibility features of browsers
            and other user agents, including assistive technologies. In order
            for something to meet a Success Criterion that requires it to be
            "programmatically determined," it would need to be implemented using
            a technology that has assistive technology support.
          </p>
          <p>
            Content that can be "programmatically determined" can be transformed
            (by user agents including AT) into different sensory formats (e.g.
            visual, auditory) or styles of presentation need by individual
            users. If existing assistive technologies cannot do this, then the
            information cannot be said to be programmatically determined.
          </p>
          <p>
            The term was created in order to allow the working group to clearly
            identify those places where information had to be accessible to
            assistive technologies (and other user agents acting as
            accessibility aids) without specifying exactly how this needed to be
            done. This is important because of the continually changing nature
            of the technologies. The term allows the guidelines to identify what
            needs to be "programmatically determined" in order to meet the
            guidelines, and then have separate documents (the How to Meet,
            Understanding, and Technique documents), which can be updated over
            time, list the specific techniques that will work and be sufficient
            at any point in time based on user agent and assistive technology
            support.

            "Accessibility Supported" vs. "Programmatically Determined"
          </h3>
          <p>
            "Accessibility supported" relates to
            <span
              >support by user agents (including assistive technologies) of
              particular ways of using </span
            >Web technologies. <span>Uses of </span>Web technologies that are
            accessibility supported will work with assistive technologies and
            access features in mainstream user agents (browsers and players
            etc.).
          </p>
          <p>
            "Programmatically determined" relates to the information in Web
            Content. If technologies that are accessibility supported are used
            properly, then assistive technologies and user agents can access the
            information in the content (i.e. programmatically determine the
            information in the content) and present it to the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two concepts work together to ensure that information can be
            presented to the user by user agents including assistive
            technologies. Authors must
            <span>rely only on uses of technologies that are</span>
            accessibility-supported — and must use them properly in order for
            the information to be programmatically determinable — and hence
            presentable, by assistive technologies and user agents to users with
            disabilities.

            Why does WCAG permit conforming alternate versions of Web pages to
            be included in conformance claims? That is, why include pages that
            do not satisfy the Success Criteria for a conformance level in the
            scope of conformance or a claim?
          </p>

                Sometimes, pages use technologies that are not yet accessibility
                supported. When a new technology emerges, assistive technology
                support may lag behind, or may only be available to some target
                audiences. So authors may not be able to rely on the new
                technology for all users. However, there may be other benefits
                to using the new technology, e.g. better performance, a wider
                range of modalities available, etc. The alternate version
                requirement allows authors to include such Web pages in their
                Web site by providing an accessible alternative page in
                technologies that are accessibility supported. Users for whom
                the new technology is adequately supported get the benefits of
                the new version. Authors who look ahead to future accessibility
                support can satisfy the Success Criteria now with the alternate
                version page, and also work with the other page to build in
                future access when assistive technology (AT) support is
                available.

                For a variety of reasons, it may not be possible to modify some
                content on a Web page. For instance,
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    It may be critical to include an exact visual copy of a

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    The Web page may be included in a site but the site owner
                    may not have the legal rights to modify the content on the
                    original page
                  </p>

                    An author may not have permission to alter a document from

                </li>

                Sometimes, the best experience for users with certain types of
                disabilities is provided by tailoring a Web page specifically to
                accommodate that disability. In such a situation, it may not be
                possible or practical to make the Web page accommodate all
                disabilities by satisfying all of the Success Criteria. The
                alternate versions requirement permits such specialized pages to
                be included within a conformance claim as long as there is a
                fully conformant 'alternate version' page.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Many sites which are committed to accessibility have large
                quantities of legacy documents. While the information has been
                made available in accessible formats, there would be significant
                institutional resistance and procedural obstacles to removing
                these files en mass. Some organizations, especially governmental
                bodies, give precedence to traditional print-oriented processes.
                Even as these organizations have adapted to Internet publishing
                and embraced the need for accessible formats, they still retain
                a paper mindset and often insist on formats designed for hard
                copy as the "primary" version (even for documents that are only
                ever "published" electronically). Although the Working Group
                feels these approaches should be deprecated it does not feel
                they can be forbidden so long as accessible versions are readily
                available.

          <p>
            A concern when permitting Web pages that do not satisfy the Success
            Criteria is that people with disabilities will encounter these
            non-conforming pages, not be able to access their content, and not
            be able to find the “conforming alternate version." A key part of
            the Alternate Versions provision, therefore, is the ability to find
            the conforming page (the alternate version) from the non-conforming
            page when it is encountered. The conformance requirement that
            permits alternate pages, therefore, also requires a way for users to
            find the accessible version among the alternate versions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that providing an alternate version is a fallback option for
            conformance to WCAG and the preferred method of conformance is to
            make all content directly accessible.

            Techniques for Providing a Conforming Alternate Version
          </h3>
          <p>
            The most important part of providing a conforming alternate version
            is providing a mechanism to find it from the non-conforming version.
            A number of different methods for doing this have been identified
            since particular techniques may not always be possible for specific
            technologies or situations. For example, if the author has control
            of the server there are some powerful techniques that will allow
            users to always have the choice up front. In many cases however the
            author may not have control of the services on their Web server. In
            these cases other techniques are provided. A link on the
            non-conforming page is another powerful technique but not all
            non-conforming technologies support hypertext links.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below are the techniques that have been identified to date. We
            expect that additional techniques will also be developed over time
            and they will be added here as they arise and the support for these
            approaches by user agents including assistive technologies can be
            demonstrated. For example a developer of a new technology that some
            assistive technologies cannot access might build in a feature that
            would allow those technologies to automatically present a link to
            users that could take them to an alternate version.

                  A large company was concerned that the use of emerging Web

                  address the needs of diverse office locations that have
                  different technology bases and individual employees who use a
                  wide variety of user agents and assistive technologies. To
                  address these concerns, the company created an alternate
                  version of the content that met all Level A Success Criteria
                  using a more limited set of
                  <span>uses of </span>accessibility-supported content

                  An information site covers a wide variety of subjects and

                  looking for. To do this, the site has implemented an
                  interactive menu system that is only supported in the most
                  recent version of two popular user agents. To ensure that
                  visitors who do not use these specific user agents are still

                  http://example.com/mail, but includes an inbox, a contacts
                  area and a calendar. Links or buttons are provided that cause
                  the inbox, contacts, or calendar to display, but do not change
                  the URI of the page as a whole.

                  content to display from a set of different content modules.

                  Example 4: When you enter "http://shopping.example.com/" in
                  your browser, you enter a movie-like interactive shopping
                  environment where you visually move around in a store dragging
                  products off of the shelves around you and into a visual
                  shopping cart in front of you. Clicking on a product causes it
                  to be demonstrated with a specification sheet floating
                  alongside. This might be a single-page Web site or just one
                  page within a Web site.

            It is important to note that, in this standard, the term "Web page"
            includes much more than static HTML pages. The term 'Web Page' was
            used in these guidelines to allow the guidelines to be more
            understandable. But the term has grown in meaning with advancing
            technologies to encompass a wide range of technologies, many of
            which are not at all 'page-like'. It also includes the increasingly
            dynamic Web pages that are emerging on the Web, including "pages"
            that can present entire virtual interactive communities. For
            example, the term "Web page" would include an immersive interactive
            movie-like experience that you find at a single URI.

            Understanding "Text Alternatives"
          </h2>
          <p>
            A text alternative is text that is used in place of non-text content
            for those who cannot view the non-text content. Non-text content
            includes such things as pictures, charts, applets, audio files, etc.
            People who cannot see for example would not be able to see
            information presented in a picture or chart. A text alternative is
            therefore provided that allows the user to be able to convert the
            information (the text) into speech. In the future, having the
            information in text also makes it possible to translate the
            information into sign language, into pictures, or into a simpler
            form of writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order for people with disabilities to be able to use this text -
            the text must be "programmatically determinable." This means that
            the text must be able to be read and used by the assistive
            technologies (and the accessibility features in browsers) that
            people with disabilities use.
          </p>
          <p>
            It must also be possible for people using assistive technologies to
            find these text alternatives when they encounter non-text content
            that they cannot use. To accomplish this, we say that the text must
            be "programmatically associated" with the non-text content. This
            means that the user must be able to use their assistive technology
            to find the alternative text (that they can use) when they land on
            the non-text content (that they can't use).
