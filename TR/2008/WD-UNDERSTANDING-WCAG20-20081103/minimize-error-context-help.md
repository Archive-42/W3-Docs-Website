Intent of this Success Criterion
--------------------------------

The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users avoid making mistakes. Some users with disabilities may be more likely to make mistakes than users without disabilities. Using context-sensitive help, users find out how to perform an operation without losing track of what they are doing.

Context-sensitive help only needs to be provided when the label is not sufficient to describe all functionality. The existence of context-sensitive help should be obvious to the user and they should be able to obtain it whenever they require it.

The content author may provide the help text, or the user agent may provide the help text based on technology-specific, programmatically determined information.

### Specific Benefits of Success Criterion 3.3.5:

-   Assistance for text input helps individuals with writing disabilities and people with reading and intellectual disabilities who often have difficulty writing text in forms or other places that need text input.

-   Additionally, these kinds of assistance help people who are aging and have the same difficulty in text input and/or mouse operation.

Examples of Success Criterion 3.3.5
-----------------------------------

-   **on-line job application**

    Some of the questions may be hard for new job seekers to understand. A help link next to each question provides instructions and explanations for each question.

Techniques and Failures for Success Criterion 3.3.5 - Help
----------------------------------------------------------

Each numbered item in this section represents a technique or combination of techniques that the WCAG Working Group deems sufficient for meeting this Success Criterion. The techniques listed only satisfy the Success Criterion if all of the [WCAG 2.0 conformance requirements](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/PR-WCAG20-20081103/#conformance-reqs) have been met.

### Sufficient Techniques

**Instructions:** Select the situation below that matches your content. Each situation includes techniques or combinations of techniques that are known and documented to be sufficient for that situation.

#### <span id="d0e10128"></span> Situation A: If a form requires text input:

1.  [G71: Providing a help link on every Web page](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20081103/G71)

2.  [G193: Providing help by an assistant in the Web page](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20081103/G193)

### Additional Techniques (Advisory) for 3.3.5

Although not required for conformance, the following additional techniques should be considered in order to make content more accessible. Not all techniques can be used or would be effective in all situations.

-   [H89: Using the title attribute to provide context-sensitive help](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20081103/H89) (HTML)
