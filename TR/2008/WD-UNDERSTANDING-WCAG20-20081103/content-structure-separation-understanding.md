===================================================================================================================================================

> **[1.3.3](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/PR-WCAG20-20081103/#content-structure-separation-understanding) Sensory Characteristics:** Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, size, visual location, orientation, or sound. (Level A)
>
> Note: For requirements related to color, refer to *[Guideline 1.4](visual-audio-contrast.html)*.

Intent of this Success Criterion
--------------------------------

The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that all users can access instructions for using the content, even when they cannot perceive shape or size or use information about spatial location or orientation. Some content relies on knowledge of the shape or position of objects that are not available from the structure of the content (for example, "round button" or "button to the right"). Some users with disabilities are not able to perceive shape or position due to the nature of the assistive technologies they use. This Success Criterion requires that additional information be provided to clarify anything that is dependent on this kind of information.

Providing information using shape and/or location, however, is an effective method for many users including those with cognitive limitations. This provision should not discourage those types of cues as long as the information is also provided in other ways.

In some languages, it is commonly understood that "above" refers to the content previous to that point in the content and "below" refers to the content after that point. In such languages, if the content being referenced is in the appropriate place in the reading order and the references are unambiguous, statements such as "choose one of the links below" or "all of the above" would conform to this Success Criterion.

### Specific Benefits of Success Criterion 1.3.3:

-   People who are blind and people who have low vision may not be able to understand information if it is conveyed by shape and/or location. Providing additional information other than shape and/or location will allow them to understand the information conveyed by shape and/or alone.

Examples of Success Criterion 1.3.3
-----------------------------------

-   **Example 1: A schedule of competitive events uses color and shape to distinguish the time of each event**

    A table presents a list of times across the top row and a list of events in the first vertical column. The cell corresponding to the time of a particular event has a specific background color and diamond shaped glyph so it can be identified by color and shape.

-   **Example 2: An on-line multi-page survey**

    An on-line multi-page survey uses a link implemented as a green arrow icon placed in the lower right hand corner of the content to move from one survey page to the next. The arrow is clearly labeled with "Next" and the instructions state, "To move to the next section of the survey, select the green arrow icon labeled 'Next' in the lower right below the last survey question." This example uses both positioning, color and labeling to help identify the icon.

Techniques and Failures for Success Criterion 1.3.3 - Sensory Characteristics
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each numbered item in this section represents a technique or combination of techniques that the WCAG Working Group deems sufficient for meeting this Success Criterion. The techniques listed only satisfy the Success Criterion if all of the [WCAG 2.0 conformance requirements](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/PR-WCAG20-20081103/#conformance-reqs) have been met.

### Sufficient Techniques

1.  [G96: Providing textual identification of items that otherwise rely only on sensory information to be understood](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20081103/G96)

### Additional Techniques (Advisory) for 1.3.3

Although not required for conformance, the following additional techniques should be considered in order to make content more accessible. Not all techniques can be used or would be effective in all situations.

-   Using an image with a text alternative for graphical symbols instead of a Unicode font glyph with the desired graphical appearance but different meaning (future link)

### Common Failures for SC 1.3.3

The following are common mistakes that are considered failures of Success Criterion 1.3.3 by the WCAG Working Group.

-   [F14: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.3 due to identifying content only by its shape or location](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20081103/F14)

-   [F26: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.3 due to using a graphical symbol alone to convey information](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20081103/F26)
