    <h2><a name="Introduction">1. Introduction</a></h2>

    <p>
      Multimedia presentations rich in text, audio, video, and graphics are
      becoming more and more common on the Web. They include newscasts,
      educational material, entertainment, etc. Formats such as SMIL 1.0 can be
      used to create dynamic multimedia presentations by synchronizing the
      various media elements in time and space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Authors can make SMIL 1.0 presentations accessible to people with
      disabilities by observing the principles discussed in the "Web Content
      Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" [<a href="#ref-WAI-WEBCONTENT">
        WAI-WEBCONTENT</a
      >]. The Guidelines explain how to create documents that account for the
      diverse abilities, tools, and software of all Web users, including people
      with combinations of visual, auditory, physical, cognitive, and
      neurological disabilities. This does not mean creating a great number of
      separate presentations but rather one integrated and accessible
      presentation. This Note applies the principles of the Web Content
      Accessibility Guidelines to SMIL 1.0 and explains which SMIL 1.0 features
      will help you create accessible presentations.

    <h3>
      <a name="Challenges"
        >1.1 Accessibility Challenges of Synchronized Multimedia</a
      >
    </h3>

    <p>
      Dynamic multimedia presents a number of challenges to people with
      disabilities and to authors of accessible content:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Authors must provide
        <a href="#Equivalent">alternative equivalent content</a> to audio and
        video so that users with visual or auditory impairments may make use of
        the presentation. Text content is most valuable to users with a wide
        range of disabilities, as it may be rendered on the screen, as speech,
        or on a refreshable braille display. In addition, search engines may
        process this text content. While there is cost to producing alternative
        content, the effort may be reduced by using accessible authoring tools
        (refer to [<a href="#ref-WAI-AUTOOLS">WAI-AUTOOLS</a>]).
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#Equivalent">Alternatives</a> to video and audio content must
        be synchronized with video and audio tracks. Alternatives that are
        improperly synchronized may be so confusing as to be unusable.
      </li>
      <li>
        A presentation may occupy multiple sensory channels (eyes, ears, and
        touch) in parallel. Any content, including
        <a href="#Equivalent">alternative content</a>, that is presented to a
        given sense must be coordinated to ensure that it remains intelligible
        when rendered with other content meant for that sense.
      </li>
      <li>
        The very nature of synchronized multimedia - content changes without
        user interaction - poses an orientation challenge to some users with
        blindness, low vision, or cognitive disabilities. These users may still
        access a presentation as long as the author has provided adequate
        alternatives and players allow sufficient control over the presentation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      <a name="PromoteAccess"
        >1.2 How Authors and Players Promote Accessibility</a
      >
    </h3>

    <p>
      Part of the responsibility for making SMIL 1.0 presentations accessible
      lies with the author and part with the user's software, the SMIL player.
      Authors must include equivalent alternatives for images, video, audio, and
      other inaccessible media. Authors must synchronize media objects correctly
      and describe relationships among objects. Authors should design documents
      that transform gracefully for players that do not support a particular
      feature (e.g., style sheets). Authors should also design documents so that
      players can ensure user control of rendering (e.g. by using the
      <span class="attribute">system-captions</span>
      <a href="#Testing">test attribute</a> to tell the player which text
      streams are captions).
    </p>

    <p>
      In turn, SMIL players must allow users to control document presentation to
      ensure its accessibility, even if that means overriding the author's
      preferences. For instance, users with low vision must be able to enlarge a
      presentation and users with color deficiencies must be able to specify
      suitable color contrasts. The "User Agent Accessibility Guidelines" [<a
        href="#ref-WAI-USERAGENT"
        >WAI-USERAGENT</a
      >] explain principles for creating accessible user agents - tools used to
      browse the Web. User agents are graphical desktop browsers, multimedia
      players, text and voice browsers, and software used in conjunction with
      other browsers, including screen readers, screen magnifiers, braille
      displays, and voice input software.
    </p>

    <p>
      User control of presentation and configuration are central to user agent
      accessibility. Players must provide users access to author-supplied media
      objects, their accessible alternatives, or both. Users must also be able
      to turn on and off alternatives (e.g., captions and auditory descriptions)
      and control their size, position, and volume. For instance, users with
      both low vision and hearing loss must be able to enlarge text captions.
      Users might also want to specify how to render synchronized audio tracks,
      for instance, by changing the volume or other available attributes of an
      auditory description to distinguish it from the audio track.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since users with some cognitive disabilities or people using combinations
      of assistive technologies such as refreshable braille and speech synthesis
      may require additional time to view a presentation or its captions,
      players must allow them to start, stop, and pause a presentation (as one
      can do with most home video players). Where possible, users should be able
      to control the global presentation rate. Some users may require that
      time-sensitive information be rendered in a time-independent form
      altogether. For example, SMIL 1.0 allows authors to designate graphical
      regions that are linked to different resources at different times. Some
      users may not have enough time to select a link with a limited lifespan,
      or even to notice it. Therefore, players should provide access to them in
      a time-independent manner. Multimedia players may also offer an index to
      time-dependent information in a time-independent form.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Note describes the accessibility features of [<a href="#ref-SMIL10"
        >SMIL10</a
      >] and explains how authors and SMIL players should make use of them.
      Explanations of implementation approaches for authors and SMIL players in
      this Note are made in accordance with the guidelines and checkpoints of
      [<a href="#ref-WAI-WEBCONTENT">WAI-WEBCONTENT</a>] and [<a
        href="#ref-WAI-USERAGENT"
        >WAI-USERAGENT</a
      >].
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Note.</strong> Most of [<a href="#ref-WAI-WEBCONTENT"
        >WAI-WEBCONTENT</a
      >] explains how authors should design their pages and sites to promote
      accessibility. However, [<a href="#ref-WAI-WEBCONTENT">WAI-WEBCONTENT</a>]
      also recognizes that some needs would be better met by user agents,
      including SMIL players. Since user agents may not yet implement some
      features that promote accessibility, [<a href="#ref-WAI-WEBCONTENT"
        >WAI-WEBCONTENT</a
      >] asks authors to compensate until they do by providing additional
      support in their content. In the current Note, the phrase "Until SMIL
      players..." refers to cases when the author should provide additional
      support. Each time the phrase appears, the requirement from [<a
        href="#ref-WAI-WEBCONTENT"
        >WAI-WEBCONTENT</a
      >] that motivated it is listed. In addition, the importance of the
      requirement to accessibility is indicated, using the vocabulary of [<a
        href="#ref-WAI-WEBCONTENT"
        >WAI-WEBCONTENT</a
      >], section four.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="Equivalent">2. Equivalent Alternatives</a></h2>

    <p>
      Multimedia presentations may include two main types of equivalent
      alternatives: discrete and continuous. Discrete equivalents do not contain
      any time references and have no intrinsic duration. In SMIL, discrete text
      equivalents are generally specified by attributes such as the
      <span class="attribute">alt</span> attribute of the
      <span class="element">img</span> element.
    </p>

    <p>
      Continuous equivalents, such as
      <a href="#def-caption">text captions</a> or
      <a href="#def-auditory-desc">auditory descriptions</a>, have intrinsic
      duration and may contain references to time. For instance, a continuous
      text equivalent consists of pieces of text associated with a time code.
      Continuous equivalents may be constructed out of discrete equivalents, for
      instance by using the SMIL elements
      <span class="element">par</span> (parallel) or
      <span class="element">seq</span> (sequential) and the timing attributes
      <span class="attribute">begin</span>,
      <span class="attribute">end</span> and <span class="attribute">dur</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Text equivalents are fundamental to accessibility since they may be
      rendered graphically, as speech, or by a braille device. In multimedia
      presentations, continuous text equivalents must be synchronized with other
      time-dependent media (refer to [<a href="#ref-WAI-WEBCONTENT"
        >WAI-WEBCONTENT</a
      >], Checkpoint 1.4, Priority 1).
    </p>

    <p>
      The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines also require that, until user
      agents can automatically read aloud the text equivalent of a video track,
      authors provide an auditory description of the important information of
      the video track of a multimedia presentation (refer to [<a
        href="#ref-WAI-WEBCONTENT"
        >WAI-WEBCONTENT</a
      >], Checkpoint 1.3, Priority 1). This benefits users who may not be able
      to read text or may not have access to software or hardware for speech
      synthesis or braille. <strong>Note.</strong> If you have captions and
      text-to-speech software, you can generate auditory descriptions. However,
      you must still ensure the proper synchronization of a generated speech
      track with other tracks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other forms of continuous equivalents also promote accessibility but are
      not discussed in this document. Representations of sign language (for
      example, a video that includes a sign language representation of the audio
      track) benefit people with auditory limitations. Simplified sound tracks
      may help people with some cognitive difficulties, such as disabilities
      that limit one's ability to concentrate.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following sections describe in more detail the SMIL features for
      specifying discrete and continuous equivalents for video, audio, text, and
      other SMIL elements.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="Discrete">2.1 Discrete Equivalents</a></h3>

    <p>
      Discrete text equivalents, when rendered by players or assistive
      technologies to the screen, as speech, or on a dynamic braille display,
      allow users to make use of the presentation even if they cannot make use
      of all of its content. For instance, providing a text equivalent of an
      image that is part of a link will enable someone with blindness to decide
      whether to follow the link. Authors specify discrete text equivalents for
      SMIL elements through the following attributes:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><span class="attribute">alt</span></dt>
      <dd>
        For media objects (image, video, audio, textstream, etc.). Specifies a
        short text equivalent that conveys the same function as the media
        object. Players may render alternative text in place of or in addition
        to media content, for instance when images or sound are turned off or
        not supported.
      </dd>
      <dt><span class="attribute">longdesc</span></dt>
      <dd>
        For media objects. Specifies a link to a long, more complete description
        of media content supplementing the description provided by
        <span class="attribute">alt</span> attribute. Authors should provide
        long descriptions of complex content, such as charts and graphs. Authors
        may use longdesc to designate a text transcript of audio and video
        information.
      </dd>
      <dt><span class="attribute">title</span></dt>
      <dd>
        For most SMIL 1.0 elements. Provides advisory information about the
        nature of the element. The SMIL 1.0 specification explains how to use
        "title" for a given element type. For example, for links, use it to
        describe the target of the link.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      Other SMIL attributes including <span class="attribute">author</span> and
      <span class="attribute">abstract</span> specify text metadata about
      document elements. Metadata generally promotes accessibility by providing
      more context and orientation. Text metadata may be rendered to the screen,
      as speech, or on a refreshable braille display. Authors are encouraged to
      enrich their presentations with metadata (refer to [<a
        href="#ref-WAI-WEBCONTENT"
        >WAI-WEBCONTENT</a
      >], Checkpoints 13.2, Priority 2 and Guidelines 12 and 13 in general).
    </p>

    <p>
      The following example includes a
      <span class="element">video</span> element that presents a dynamic graph
      illustrating trends in Web commerce and privacy. The
      <span class="attribute">alt</span>, <span class="attribute">title</span>,
      and <span class="attribute">abstract</span> attributes specify discrete
      text equivalents that provide information with different granularity. The
      <span class="attribute">longdesc</span> attribute designates a more
      complete text equivalent of the video presentation, with details about
      what information is being displayed in the graph, the units of the graph,
      etc. The long description itself might also include links back to anchors
      associated with key points of the presentation (not shown here) so that
      users can navigate back and forth.
    </p>

    <pre class="example"><code>&lt;video src="http://www.fou.fr/graph.mpeg"

    <p>
      <strong>Note.</strong> The above example shows one usage of the
      <span class="attribute">alt</span> and
      <span class="attribute">title</span> attributes together. The SMIL 1.0
      specification does not clearly explain the relationship between the two
      attributes. We recommend that authors use
      <span class="attribute">title</span> when
      <span class="attribute">alt</span>
      is not available (e.g., to describe
      <span class="element">par</span> and
      <span class="element">seq</span> synchronization, link destinations,
      layout, etc.) The relationship between the attributes should be clarified
      by W3C Working Groups in an future version of SMIL.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Note.</strong> In the examples in this document, "rt" suggests a
      "real text" media object file, "rm" a real audio file, and "mpeg" an MPEG
      file.

      Two continuous equivalents that promote accessibility are captions and
      auditory descriptions. A <a name="def-caption">caption</a> is a text
      transcript of spoken words and non-spoken sound effects that provides the
      same information as a presentation's audio stream and is synchronized with
      the video track of the presentation. Captions benefit people who are deaf,
      hard of hearing, or who have auditory learning disabilities. They also
      benefit anyone in a setting where audio tracks would cause disturbance,
      where ambient noise in the audio track or listening environment prevents
      them from hearing the audio track, or when they have difficulties
      understanding spoken language.
    </p>

    <p>
      An <a name="def-auditory-desc">auditory description</a> is a recorded or
      synthesized voice that describes key visual elements of the presentation
      including information about actions, body language, graphics, and scene
      changes. Like captions, auditory descriptions must be synchronized with
      the video stream they describe. Additionally, they must be synchronized
      with other audio streams. Auditory descriptions are generally timed to
      play during natural pauses in dialog. However, there may be cases where
      these natural pauses are not long enough to accommodate a sufficient
      auditory description. In such cases, it will be necessary to pause the
      video in order to provide enough time for an extended auditory
      description. At the end of the description, the video should resume play
      automatically. Auditory descriptions benefit people with blindness, low
      vision, or some kinds of visual perceptive learning disabilities. They
      also benefit anyone in an eyes-busy setting or whose devices cannot show
      the original video or graphical media object.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below we discuss in more detail how to associate captions and auditory
      descriptions with multimedia presentations in SMIL 1.0 in a manner that
      allows users to control the presentation of the alternative stream. We
      also examine how SMIL 1.0 supports multilingual presentations and how this
      affects continuous equivalents for accessibility. For more information
      about synchronizing media objects, please consult the SMIL 1.0
      specification ([<a href="#ref-SMIL10">SMIL10</a>]).
    </p>

    <h4><a name="Captions">2.2.1 Captions</a></h4>

    <p>
      In SMIL 1.0, captions may be included in a presentation with the
      textstream element. The following example plays an audio track, a video
      track, and captions (via the textstream element) in parallel.
    </p>
    <pre class="example"><code>&lt;par>
   &lt;audio alt="Interview with Harvey, English audio" 
          src="audio.rm"/>
   &lt;video alt="Interview with Harvey" src="video.rm"/>
   &lt;textstream alt="English captions for interview with Harvey"
               src="closed-caps.rt"/>
&lt;/par></code></pre>

    <p>
      The limitation of the example is that the user cannot easily turn on or
      off the captions. This is corrected in the next example.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since user control of presentation is vital to accessibility, SMIL 1.0
      allows authors to create presentations whose behavior varies depending on
      current player settings. When a SMIL element such as textstream has the
      <span class="attribute">system-captions</span> test attribute with value
      "on" and the user has turned on captioning, the element will be rendered.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following example is a movie that consists of four media object
      elements: a video track, an audio soundtrack, and text streams of captions
      and stock values (for the avid stock market tracker!). All the elements
      are to be played in parallel due to the
      <span class="element">par</span> element. The captions will only be
      rendered if the user has turned on captioning.
    </p>
    <pre class="example"><code> &lt;par>
   &lt;audio alt="My Favorite Movie, English audio" src="audio.rm"/>
   &lt;video alt="My Favorite Movie" src="video.rm"/>
   &lt;textstream alt="Stock ticker" src="stockticker.rt"/>
   &lt;textstream alt="English captions for My Favorite Movie"
               system-captions="on"
               src="closed-caps.rt"/>
&lt;/par></code></pre>

    <p>
      The <span class="attribute">system-captions</span> attribute can also be
      used with elements other than textstream. Like the other SMIL
      <a href="#Testing">test attributes</a> (described in [<a
        href="#ref-SMIL10"
        >SMIL</a
      >], section 4.4), <span class="attribute">system-captions</span> acts like
      a boolean flag that returns "true" or "false" according to player
      settings. <a href="#Layout">Section 3.1</a> below illustrates how
      <span class="attribute">system-captions</span> can be used to specify
      different presentation layouts according to whether the user has
      captioning turned on.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Note.</strong> Authors should use
      <span class="attribute">system-captions="on"</span> with elements that
      specify captions and
      <span class="attribute">system-captions="off"</span> for caption-related
      effects such as layout changes.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="AudioDesc">2.2.2 Auditory Descriptions</a></h4>

    <p>
      In SMIL 1.0, auditory descriptions may be included in a presentation with
      the audio element. However, SMIL 1.0 does not provide a mechanism that
      allows users to turn on or off player support for auditory descriptions.
      Authors may wish to create one presentation with no auditory description
      and another with an auditory description.
    </p>

    <h4>
      <a name="Multilingual"
        >2.2.3 Multilingual Presentations and Continuous Equivalents</a
      >
    </h4>

    <p>
      SMIL 1.0 allows authors to create multilingual presentations by using
      subtitles (which are text streams) and overdubs (which are audio streams)
      in another language. Multilingual presentations themselves do not pose
      accessibility problems. Indeed, providing additional tracks (even in a
      different language) will help many users.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, since subtitles and overdubs may co-exist with text and audio
      streams provided for accessibility, authors of accessible multilingual
      presentations should be aware of how they interact. For instance, authors
      should lay out presentations so that captions and subtitles do not overlap
      on the screen. Audio tracks should not overlap unless carefully
      synchronized.
    </p>

    <p>
      In SMIL 1.0, the <span class="attribute">system-overdub-or-caption</span>
      test attribute allows users to select (through the player's user
      interface) whether they would rather have the player render overdubs or
      subtitles.
      <strong>Note.</strong> The term "caption" in "system-overdub-or-caption"
      does not refer to accessibility captions. Authors must not use this
      attribute to create accessibility captions; use
      <span class="attribute">system-captions</span> instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following example offers a movie in both Spanish and English. If the
      player is set for preferences of Spanish <em>and</em> overdubs, the
      Spanish audio track will be rendered. Otherwise the second audio track of
      the first switch element (the English audio track) will be rendered. The
      second textstream specifies English captions that will be rendered when
      the player is set for captioning.
    </p>
    <pre class="example"><code>&lt;par>
   &lt;switch> &lt;!-- audio -->
     &lt;audio alt="My Favorite Movie, Spanish audio"
            src="audio-es.rm"
            system-overdub-or-caption="overdub"
            system-language="es"/>
     &lt;audio alt="My Favorite Movie, English audio"
            src="audio.rm"/>
   &lt;/switch>
   &lt;video alt="My Favorite Movie" src="video.rm"/>
   &lt;textstream alt="Stock ticker" src="stockticker.rt"/>
   &lt;textstream alt="English captions for My Favorite Movie"
               src="closed-caps.rt"
               system-captions="on"/>
&lt;/par></code></pre>

    <p>
      To add Spanish subtitles to the example, the author would specify a second
      textstream element. The first textstream in the switch element will be
      rendered if the player is set for captioning. Otherwise, the second
      textstream element will be rendered if the user has set the player to
      prefer subtitles and Spanish.
    </p>
    <pre class="example"><code>&lt;par>
   &lt;switch> &lt;!-- audio -->
     &lt;audio alt="My Favorite Movie, Spanish audio"
            src="audio-es.rm"
            system-overdub-or-caption="overdub"
            system-language="es"/>
     &lt;audio alt="My Favorite Movie, English audio"
            src="audio.rm"/>
   &lt;/switch>
   &lt;video alt="My Favorite Movie" src="video.rm"/>
   &lt;textstream alt="Stock ticker" src="stockticker.rt"/>
   &lt;switch> &lt;!-- captions or subtitles -->
     &lt;textstream alt="English captions for My Favorite Movie"
                 src="closed-caps.rt"
                 system-captions="on"/>
     &lt;textstream alt="Spanish subtitles for My Favorite Movie"
                 src="subtitles-es.rt"
                 system-overdub-or-caption="caption"
                 system-language="es"/>
   &lt;/switch>
&lt;/par></code></pre>

    <p>
      While subtitles only capture dialog in text, captions include dialog as
      well as text descriptions of off-screen information (e.g., sounds);
      authors should provide captions when possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the <span class="element">switch</span> element, the three textstream
      elements are rendered in order of preference for Spanish captions, Spanish
      subtitles, or the default (English) captions. This design allows authors
      to reuse the captions as subtitles and to ensure that the textstream is
      not rendered twice when the player is set to support both.
    </p>
    <pre class="example"><code>&lt;par>
   &lt;switch> &lt;!-- audio -->
     &lt;audio alt="My Favorite Movie, Spanish audio"
            src="audio-es.rm"
            system-overdub-or-caption="overdub"
            system-language="es"/>
     &lt;audio alt="My Favorite Movie, English audio"
            src="audio.rm"/>
   &lt;/switch>
   &lt;video alt="My Favorite Movie" src="video.rm"/>
   &lt;textstream alt="Stock ticker" src="stockticker.rt"/>
   &lt;switch> &lt;!-- captions or subtitles -->
     &lt;textstream alt="Spanish captions for My Favorite Movie"
                 src="closed-caps-es.rt"
                 system-captions="on"
                 system-language="es"/>
     &lt;textstream alt="Spanish subtitles for My Favorite Movie"
                 src="closed-caps-es.rt"
                 system-overdub-or-caption="caption"
                 system-language="es"/>
     &lt;textstream alt="English captions for My Favorite Movie"
                 src="closed-caps.rt"
                 system-captions="on"/>
   &lt;/switch>
&lt;/par></code></pre>

    <p>
      <strong>Note.</strong> In SMIL 1.0, values for
      <span class="attribute">system-overdub-or-caption</span> only refer to
      user preferences for <em>either</em> subtitles <em>or</em> overdubs; there
      are no values for the test attribute that refer to neither or both.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="LayoutStyle">3. Layout and Style</a></h2>

    <p>
      While it is important for players to respect author-specified layout and
      style for a presentation, the author's design may not take into
      consideration variations in a user's abilities, hardware, software, or
      viewing environment. Players must allow users to control styles and
      layout, otherwise users with some disabilities may not be able to make use
      of a presentation at all. For instance, players must allow users to
      control colors (e.g., for users with color deficiencies), text size (e.g.,
      for users with low vision), caption position (e.g., if a caption overlaps
      other content), etc. Please refer to [<a href="#ref-WAI-USERAGENT"
        >WAI-USERAGENT</a
      >] for more information about user control of styles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Authors may specify the graphical layout of SMIL 1.0 media objects through
      SMIL's basic layout language or with a style sheet language such as CSS
      [<a href="#ref-CSS1">CSS1</a>, <a href="#ref-CSS2">CSS2</a>].
      <strong>Note.</strong> Media objects referenced from a SMIL 1.0
      presentation may have associated style sheets. SMIL 1.0 does not specify
      how they interact with style sheets for the SMIL presentation itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Note.</strong> While SMIL 1.0 includes support for style sheets,
      SMIL 1.0 players, as of the publication of this document, do not support
      CSS. Please refer to [<a href="#ref-SMIL-CSS-LAYOUT">SMIL-CSS-LAYOUT</a>]
      for information about rendering SMIL basic layout with a CSS2 engine. The
      Web Content Accessibility Guidelines recommend that authors specify style
      through style sheets when supported by user agents (including SMIL
      players). One reason the guidelines recommend style sheets (refer to [<a
        href="#ref-CSS-ACCESS"
        >CSS-ACCESS</a
      >]) is that in the CSS2 cascade, user-specified style sheets can override
      author-specified style sheets (refer to the "!important" mechanism
      described in section 6.4.2 of [<a href="#ref-CSS2">CSS2</a>]).
    </p>

    <h3><a name="Layout">3.1 Layout</a></h3>

    <p>
      Authors specify the graphical layout of a SMIL 1.0 presentation inside the
      <span class="element">layout</span> element, using either the SMIL basic
      layout language or style sheets. SMIL's layout facilities allow authors to
      arrange rectangular regions graphically (via the
      <span class="element">region</span> element), much like positioning in
      CSS2.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following example illustrates how to regain space when captions are
      turned off or not supported. In this example, the same layout is specified
      with both the SMIL basic layout language and CSS2 style sheets. Due to
      their order in the <span class="element">switch</span> element, the SMIL
      player will use the CSS style sheet if supported, otherwise it will use
      the SMIL layout. The <span class="attribute">type</span> attribute of the
      <span class="element">layout</span> element specifies the MIME type of the
      style sheet language, here "text/css".
    </p>

    <p>
      The example specifies two layouts. When the user has chosen to view
      captions, they appear in a region (the "captext" region) that takes up 20%
      of available vertical space below a region for the video presentation (the
      "capvideo" region), which takes up the other 80%. When the user does not
      wish to view captions, the video region takes up all available vertical
      space (the "video" region). The choice of which layout to use depends on
      the value of the <span class="attribute">system-captions</span> test
      attribute.
    </p>
    <pre class="example"><code>&lt;smil>
&nbsp; &lt;head>
    &lt;switch>
      &lt;layout type="text/css">
        { top: 20px; left: 20px }
        [region="video"] {top: 0px; height: 100%}
        [region="capvideo"] {top: 0px; height: 80%}
        [region="captext"] {top: 80%; height: 20%; overflow: scroll}
      &lt;/layout>
      &lt;layout>
        &lt;region id="video" title="Full-size video pane"
                top="0" height="100%" fit="meet"/>
        &lt;region id="capvideo" 
                title="Video pane for use with caption window"
                top="0" height="80%" fit="meet"/>
        &lt;region id="captext" title="Caption pane"
                top="80%" height="20%" fit="scroll"/>
      &lt;/layout>
    &lt;/switch>
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
    &lt;switch> &lt;!-- if captions off use first region, else second -->
    &lt;par system-captions="on">
        &lt;video region="capvideo" src="movie-vid.rm"
            alt="Video presentation of soccer match"
            title="Finals of Womens World Cup 1999"/>
        &lt;textstream region="captext" src="closed-caps.rt"
            alt="English caption of soccer match"/>
    &lt;/par>
    &lt;video region="video" src="movie-vid.rm"
            alt="Video presentation of soccer match"
            title="Finals of Womens World Cup 1999" 
            system-captions="off"/>
    &lt;/switch>
&lt;/body>
&lt;/smil></code></pre>

    <h3><a name="Style">3.2 Style</a></h3>

    <p>
      In the SMIL 1.0 basic layout language, the only style attribute that can
      be specified is <span class="attribute">background-color</span>. Authors
      must ensure sufficient contrast between foreground and background colors
      of content, otherwise users with color deficiencies will not be able to
      perceive them (refer to [<a href="#ref-WAI-WEBCONTENT">WAI-WEBCONTENT</a
      >], Checkpoint 2.2, Priority 2). If
      <span class="attribute">background-color</span> is set and media objects
      (e.g., video, text, etc.) have transparent backgrounds, authors must
      ensure that the colors exhibit sufficient contrast. Players must allow
      users to control background colors to ensure accessibility.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="Popups">3.3 Opening New Windows</a></h3>

    <p>
      The <span class="attribute">show</span> attribute on the
      <span class="element">a</span> and
      <span class="element">anchor</span> elements controls the behavior of the
      source document containing the link when the link is followed. The default
      value of the attribute is "replace", which means that the destination
      presentation replaces the current presentation (in the same window, in
      audio, etc.).
    </p>

    <p>
      Two other values for the attribute, "new" and "pause", cause the
      destination presentation to appear in a new context (e.g., window).
      Opening new windows without warning may disorient users with blindness or
      some cognitive impairments and may simply bother others. SMIL players must
      help orient users when windows open or focus changes (e.g., by using audio
      cues, by providing a history mechanism so users can return to a familiar
      state, etc.). Until players do so, authors should provide clues in content
      (e.g., via the <span class="attribute">title</span> attribute) whenever
      they intend to open a new window (refer to [<a href="#ref-WAI-WEBCONTENT"
        >WAI-WEBCONTENT</a
      >], Checkpoint 10.1, Priority 2).
    </p>

    <h2><a name="Navigation">4. Navigation and Linking</a></h2>

    <p>
      SMIL 1.0 includes a number of hyperlink features, including HTML-like
      hyperlinks and image maps (as well as video maps). SMIL 1.0 also allows
      authors to create time-dependent hyperlinks that are only active during
      author-specified intervals of a presentation. This section discusses the
      accessibility of these features.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="Maps">4.1 Accessible Image/Video Maps</a></h3>

    <p>
      To create an accessible image or video map, authors must describe the
      nature of each link in the map for users who cannot see or use the visual
      information. Authors provide the description via the
      <span class="attribute">title</span> attribute on the
      <span class="element">a</span> and
      <span class="element">anchor</span> elements. This text description may be
      rendered by SMIL players on the screen or by assistive technologies as
      speech or dynamic braille.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is an example of a video clip with an associated map. Each link
      describes an active rectangular region of the video via the
      <span class="attribute">coords</span> attribute.
    </p>
    <pre class="example"><code>&lt;video src="http://www.w3.org/CoolStuff.rm">
  &lt;anchor href="http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo" 
          coords="0%,0%,50%,50%"
          title="W3C Multimedia Activity"/>
  &lt;anchor href="http://www.w3.org/Style"      
          coords="50%,50%,100%,100%"
          title="W3C Style Sheet Activity"/>
&lt;/video></code></pre>

    <p>
      With the <span class="element">anchor</span> element, authors may
      associate a link source with spatial and temporal subparts of a media
      object. With the <span class="element">a</span> element, authors may only
      associate a link source with a complete media object.
    </p>

    <p>
      SMIL players should provide an equivalent text link for each graphical
      link (for example, using link text derived from the
      <span class="attribute">title</span> attribute of the linking element or
      the <span class="attribute">alt</span> attribute of an active media object
      inside the link). Text links are important to users with blindness or low
      vision who often navigate documents by jumping from link to link and
      having the link text rendered by a speech synthesizer or refreshable
      braille display. Until SMIL players provide alternative text links,
      authors should include text links in addition to non-text links (refer to
      [<a href="#ref-WAI-WEBCONTENT">WAI-WEBCONTENT</a>], Checkpoint 1.5,
      Priority 3).
    </p>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <pre class="example"><code>&lt;par>
   &lt;video title="Introduction to W3C Activities"

      The time-dependent linking mechanisms offered by SMIL 1.0 pose an
      accessibility challenge to both authors and players. The following example
      from the SMIL 1.0 specification illustrates time-dependent linking. In the
      example, the duration of a video clip is split into two time intervals:
      from 0 to 5 seconds and from 5 to 10 seconds. A different link is
      associated with each of these intervals.
    </p>
    <pre class="example"><code>&lt;video title="Introduction to W3C Activities"
          alt="W3C Activities"
          longdesc="http://www.w3.org/Activity/Summary"
          src="http://www.w3.org/CoolStuff.rm">
  &lt;anchor href="http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo" 
          title="W3C Multimedia Activity"

&lt;/video></code></pre>

    <p>
      Some users require more time to interact with the presentation than
      anticipated by the author. SMIL players may make time-dependent links
      accessible to users in a number of ways, including allowing the user to
      control the overall timing of the presentation (e.g., easy to control
      pause and rewind functionalities) or by providing users with
      time-independent access to those links (e.g., a list of static links).
      Authors may facilitate access to time-dependent links by providing a
      catalog of them in a separate document (linked from the presentation). In
      this catalog, the static list of links may include information about when
      the links are active during the presentation. This type of catalog will
      help all users, and allow people to find information about all links
      associated with a particular media object or that are active at a
      particular moment of the presentation.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="UsefulNav">4.3 Useful Navigation Mechanisms</a></h3>

    <p>
      Navigation mechanisms help all users but are particularly important for
      users with blindness or some cognitive impairments who may not be able to
      grasp the structure of a presentation through visual clues. In addition to
      HTML-like linking mechanisms that may be used to create site maps and
      navigation bars, SMIL allows authors to create "temporal navigation bars"
      that allow users to navigate directly to important points in time of a
      presentation.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an example, we first identify key points in a presentation that
      includes three interviews conducted sequentially (Joe, Tim, then Judy).
      Each segment is marked by an anchor (identified by the "id" attribute).
    </p>
    <pre class="example"><code>&lt;smil>
&lt;head>
   &lt;layout>
     &lt;region id="video" top="0" height="100%" fit="meet"/>
   &lt;/layout>
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
   &lt;video src="http://www.w3.org/BBC.rm" 
	  region="video"
	  title="Future of the Web"
	  alt="Interview with Joe, Tim, and Judy for BBC"
	  abstract="The BBC interviews Joe, Tim, and Judy about 
		  the Future of the Web. Joe and Tim talk about
		  social and technological impact. Judy 
		  addresses the benefits to accessibility of
		  good design.">
     &lt;anchor id="joe" begin="0s" end="5s"
	     href="http://www.w3.org/Interviews/BBC/Joe"
	     title="Joe interview on Web trends"/>
     &lt;anchor id="tim" begin="5s" end="10s"
	     href="http://www.w3.org/Interviews/BBC/Tim"
	     title="Tim interview on Web trends"/>
     &lt;anchor id="judy" begin="10s" end="60s"
	     href="http://www.w3.org/Interviews/BBC/Judy"
	     title="Judy interview on Web accessibility"/>
   &lt;/video>
&lt;/body>
&lt;/smil></code></pre>

    <p>
      Authors might add a temporal navigation bar in parallel with the
      presentation. The navigation bar takes up the lower 10% of the
      presentation, and consists of a photo of each of the interviewees that
      links to their interview. Selecting a link causes player to play that part
      of the video. Refer to
      <a href="#Popups">section 3.3 on opening new windows</a> for information
      about where the interview will be played.

    <h2>
      <a name="Testing">5. Adapting Content to User and System Settings</a>
    </h2>

    <p>
      SMIL 1.0 includes "test attributes" that the author may use to suggest how
      a presentation should vary according to user preferences for subtitles,
      overdubs, captions, content language, connection speed, screen depth, and
      screen size. For each test attribute, players should allow users to set
      appropriate preferences. The use of test attributes for captions,
      overdubs, and language is described above in
      <a href="#Continuous">Section 2.2</a>. The other test attributes are used
      in a similar manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, the author may use the
      <span class="attribute">system-bitrate</span> attribute to suggest that,
      for slow connections, a player should download text instead of video or
      audio. Some users may desire higher bandwidth content even over a slow
      connection while others may desire lower bandwidth content over a fast
      connection (e.g., users with some cognitive impairments). Therefore,
      players should let users know that content is available at different bit
      rates (or in different languages, for different screen sizes, etc.) and
      give users access to that content.
    </p>

    <p>
      The player may also choose to override the author's bandwidth hints. For
      instance, the player might be capable of automatically adjusting the
      presentation quality according to the available bandwidth. This would help
      preserve synchronization when there is high traffic load.
    </p>

    <p>
      These are the SMIL 1.0 test attributes that may be used with
      synchronization elements (defined in section 4.2 of [<a href="#ref-SMIL10"
        >SMIL10</a
      >]):
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><span class="attribute">system-captions</span></dt>
      <dd>
        Tests user preferences for captions (refer to
        <a href="#Continuous">Section 2.2</a>).
      </dd>
      <dt><span class="attribute">system-overdub-or-caption</span></dt>
      <dd>
        Tests user preferences for overdubs or subtitles (refer to
        <a href="#Continuous">Section 2.2</a>).
      </dd>
      <dt><span class="attribute">system-language</span></dt>
      <dd>
        Tests natural language preferences. <strong>Note.</strong> This test
        attribute does not specify the natural of language of an element's
        contents or an attribute's value; this is the role of the "xml:lang"
        attribute, defined in XML 1.0 ([<a href="#ref-XML10">XML10</a>], section
        2.12). However, "xml:lang" is not included in the SMIL 1.0 DTD.
        Therefore documents that include it will not validate to this DTD.
      </dd>
      <dt><span class="attribute">system-bitrate</span></dt>
      <dd>
        Tests preferences for the minimum approximate bandwidth (in bits per
        second) required to display the element. This attribute can be used to
        suggest changes in a presentation based on available bandwidth.
      </dd>
      <dt><span class="attribute">system-screen-depth</span></dt>
      <dd>
        Tests preferences for the minimum depth of the screen color palette (in
        bits) required to display the element. This attribute can be used to
        suggest changes in a presentation based on the ability of the screen to
        display images or video at a certain color depth.
      </dd>
      <dt><span class="attribute">system-screen-size</span></dt>
      <dd>
        Tests preferences for the minimum required screen size (in X and Y
        pixels) to display the element. This attribute can be used to suggest
        changes in a presentation based on screen size.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      The following example suggests that different video tracks be delivered
      according to the user's connection speed preferences. The player evaluates
      each of the choices in the <span class="element">switch</span> element in
      order and chooses the first one whose
      <span class="attribute">system-bitrate</span> value is equal to or greater
      than the user's preferred connection speed. No video will be played for
      connection speeds less than 10,000 bits per second.
    </p>
    <pre class="example"><code>&lt;switch>
   &lt;video title="My Favorite Movie" longdesc="MyFavMovie"
          src="high-quality-movie.rm" system-bitrate="40000"/>
   &lt;video title="My Favorite Movie" longdesc="MyFavMovie"
          src="medium-quality-movie.rm" system-bitrate="24000"/>
   &lt;video title="My Favorite Movie" longdesc="MyFavMovie"
          src="low-quality-movie.rm" system-bitrate="10000"/>
&lt;/switch></code></pre>

    <h3><a name="Relative">5.1 Relative Attribute Values</a></h3>

    <p>
      Presentations that are specified in relative rather than absolute terms
      may be more easily adapted to a variety of output devices and viewing
      contexts.
    </p>

    <p>In SMIL 1.0, relative attribute values are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Percentage values for the <span class="attribute">coords</span>,
        <span class="attribute">height</span>,
        <span class="attribute">width</span>,
        <span class="attribute">top</span>, and
        <span class="attribute">left</span> attributes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Relative length values for the <span class="attribute">height</span>,
        <span class="attribute">width</span>,
        <span class="attribute">top</span>, and
        <span class="attribute">left</span> attributes. The only relative length
        unit supported in SMIL 1.0 is "px", defined in [<a href="#ref-CSS2"
          >CSS2</a
        >], section 4.3.2.
      </li>

      <li>
        The <span class="element">region</span> element's
        <span class="attribute">fit</span> attribute describes how to scale
        graphical media objects.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Players may offer other scaling strategies such as graphical zoom.</p>

    <h3><a name="Relative">5.1 Relative Timing</a></h3>

    <p>
      Specifying synchronization in SMIL offers some advantages over relying on
      time codes in external resources. One advantage is that authors may use
      relative timing with the <span class="element">par</span>,
      <span class="element">seq</span>, <span class="element">begin</span>,
      <span class="element">end</span>, and
      <span class="element">dur</span> elements instead of absolute time codes
      alone. This may promote accessibility since timing relationships described
      relatively may be more easily controlled and changed according to user
      needs. Therefore they may be adapted to a variety of output devices and
      scenarios (just as relative layouts may be scaled graphically).
    </p>

    <p>
      In most of the examples in this document, the only synchronization among
      media objects specified in SMIL is done by using the
      <span class="element">par</span> element to synchronize beginnings. We
      assume that other necessary synchronization has been specified in the
      formats that encode the media objects.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="More">6. To Learn More about Accessibility and SMIL</a></h2>

    <p>
      The first place to learn more about SMIL is the Recommendation itself [<a
        href="#ref-SMIL10"
        >SMIL10</a
      >]. The Synchronized Multimedia Home Page ([<a href="#ref-SYMM">SYMM</a>])
      at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C Web site</a> also includes
      information about SMIL tutorials, SMIL authoring tricks, examples of
      interesting presentations, player support for SMIL, and links to other
      sources of information about SMIL.
    </p>

    <p>
      For more information about making SMIL presentations accessible, authors
      should consult the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([<a
        href="#ref-WAI-WEBCONTENT"
        >WAI-WEBCONTENT</a
      >]). The Guidelines Document assigns a priority to each checkpoint based
      on the checkpoint's importance to accessibility. The accompanying
      Techniques Document ([<a href="#ref-WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS"
        >WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS</a
      >]) explains the guidelines and checkpoints in detail and includes many
      examples of ways to satisfy them. Although the Techniques Document
      emphasizes HTML and CSS, many of the principles and examples apply to SMIL
      as well.

    <p>
      Player developers should consult the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines
      ([<a href="#ref-WAI-USERAGENT">WAI-USERAGENT</a>) and accompanying
      techniques document ([<a href="#ref-WAI-USERAGENT-TECHS"
        >WAI-USERAGENT-TECHS</a

      <a name="Sample">Appendix B. Sample Accessible SMIL Presentation</a>
    </h2>

    <p>
      The following sample has been provided by the CPB/WGBH National Center for
      Accessible Media (refer to [<a href="#ref-WGBH-NCAM">WGBH-NCAM</a>]). The
      presentation contains captions, subtitles and auditory descriptions in
      English and German. To play the presentation, you will need to download
      the G2 player from [<a href="#ref-REAL">REAL</a>]. Information about this
      and other SMIL players is available at the W3C Synchronized Multimedia
      Home Page ([<a href="#ref-SYMM">SYMM</a>]).
    </p>

    <p>Once you have installed the player, follow the instructions below:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Download the <a href="SMIL-access-sample.zip">sample presentation</a>,
        which is stored in a zip file.
      </li>
      <li>Unzip the zip file, which contains "car.smi" and other files.</li>
      <li>
        Start the player. Before playing the movie, you'll need to set
        preferences to display captions (or subtitles) and descriptions in
        either English or German:
        <ol>
          <li>Open the Options menu.</li>
          <li>Choose Preferences.</li>
          <li>Choose the Content tab.</li>
          <li>Choose English or German from the Language listbox.</li>
          <li>Check the Enable Captions box at the bottom of the window.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Open "car.smi" and play it. You should see captions or subtitles below
        the video window and hear audio descriptions interspersed with the
        program narration.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Here is an English transcript of the presentation. It includes the text of
      the presentation's auditory description and the narration.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Description:</dt>
      <dd>An animation of a car and a clock.</dd>
      <dt>Narrator:</dt>
      <dd>
        Someone watching a car accelerate toward light speed would see something
        very strange. It would seem as though the car itself were getting
        shorter and that time for the person in the car was slowing down.
      </dd>
      <dt>Description:</dt>
      <dd>The car shrinks.</dd>
      <dt>Narrator:</dt>
      <dd>
        However, you wouldn't see these effects until the car began to approach
        the speed of light. At 90% of the speed of light, the car would appear
        to shrink to 44% of its usual length.
      </dd>
      <dt>Description:</dt>
      <dd>An animation of a lightwave.</dd>
      <dt>Narrator:</dt>
      <dd>
        This thought experiment answered Einstein's old question about what he
        would see if he traveled along with a beam of light. He simply couldn't
        make the trip, for at the speed of light, length would contract to zero
        and time would stop.
      </dd>
      <dt>Description:</dt>
      <dd>
        An animation of Albert Einstein running alongside a lightwave. He keeps
        up for a moment, then falls behind. The lightwave breaks up in a series
        of large colored dots.

    <h2><a name="About-WAI">About the Web Accessibility Initiative</a></h2>

    <p>
      W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) addresses accessibility of the
      Web through five complementary activities that:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ensure that the technology of the Web supports accessibility</li>
      <li>Develop accessibility guidelines</li>
      <li>Develop tools to facilitate evaluation and repair of Web sites</li>
      <li>Conduct education and outreach</li>
      <li>Coordinate with research and development</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      WAI's International Program Office enables partnering of industry,
      disability organizations, accessibility research organizations, and
      governments interested in creating an accessible Web. WAI sponsors include
      the US National Science Foundation and Department of Education's National
      Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research; the European
      Commission's DG XIII Telematics for Disabled and Elderly Programme;
      Telematics Applications Programme for Disabled and Elderly; Government of
      Canada, Industry Canada; IBM, Lotus Development Corporation, and NCR.

    <h2><a name="About-W3C">About the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a></h2>

    <p>
      The W3C was created to lead the Web to its full potential by developing
      common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its
      interoperability. It is an international industry consortium jointly run
      by the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) in the USA, the National
      Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control (INRIA) in France
      and Keio University in Japan. Services provided by the Consortium include:
      a repository of information about the World Wide Web for developers and
      users; reference code implementations to embody and promote standards; and
      various prototype and sample applications to demonstrate use of new
      technology. To date, more than 350 organizations are Members of the
      Consortium. For more information about the World Wide Web Consortium, see
