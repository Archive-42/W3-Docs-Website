- ## <a href="/community/decentralizdcomm/" id="decentralizdcomm">Decentralized Communications</a>

  Created on 24 March 2017 <span class="participants" data-participants="28">(28 participants)</span>

  The mission of this group is to specify and build a reference implementation of Decentralized Communications. Decentralized Communications enables natively inter-operable communication services that are able to trustfully use peer to peer connections without having to use central authorities or services. Decentralized Comms are inherently inter-operable without using standard protocols by using the Protocol on-the-fly concept, where the most appropriate protocol stack to be used, is selected and instantiated at run-time.

  Open Science has considered as a alternative of the entire research cycle to improve sustainable value of science. This group's goal is to develop various resource including documents and sources based on an existing knowledge (e.g. open access, open data, open source, etc.) for motivating and smooth landing on doing the open science. As a alternative of a existing scientific paradigm, this group is to introduce a general and standard filed guide for Open Science Research Cycle, to generate a logical alternative for conflict concern for open science, to provide a framework(or IDE) to implement the open science paradigm, and to develop meta data using existing knowledge (e.g. ontology, semantic web, machine learning)

- ## <a href="/community/dui/" id="dui">Distributed User Interfaces</a>

  Created on 9 February 2017 <span class="participants" data-participants="10">(10 participants)</span>

  Current technology and ICT models generate configurations where the same user interface can be offered through different interactions. These new technological ecosystems appear as a result of the existence of many heterogeneous devices and interaction mechanisms. Consequently, new conditions and possibilities arise which not only affects the distribution of the user interfaces but also the distribution of the involved users’ interactions. Thus, we move the focus from addressing the distribution of user interfaces to the distribution of the users’ interactions which poses new challenges that deserve to be explored. In this context Web engineering appears as a fundamental research field since it helps to develop device-independent Web applications with user interfaces capable of being distributed and accessed through different interaction modes. This fact makes Web environments to be especially interesting within the scope of this community group. The main goal is to join people working on Distributed Interactions and share their knowledge in aspects related to new interaction paradigms and the way we can manage them in a distributed setting on the World Wide Web.

  The mission of the Schema Generator Community Group is to improve the availability, discovery and innovation of RDFa, Microdata, JSON-LD and other structured data related tooling. Schema generation tools pertaining to this group aim to ensure output can be validated with the W3C Schema validator or similar tools.

  The group will assist others with discovering existing tools, updating online materials to find tools and supporting the development of new tools. The goal of this group is to foster the development of the ‘web of data’ through developer support, community engagement and advocacy. The Schema Generator Community Group will also assist by incubating support for works that include, but are not limited to, new RDF-related tools.

- ## <a href="/community/httpslocal/" id="httpslocal">HTTPS in Local Network</a>

  Created on 6 February 2017 <span class="participants" data-participants="41">(41 participants)</span>

  The HTTPS in Local Network Community Group (CG) explores the manner of secure communication between browsers and server-capable devices in local network such as set-top boxes, network attached storages, etc. We propose that this Community Group clarify requirements for browsers and devices in issuing valid certificates and establishment of HTTPS and WebSocket connections over TLS and incubate relevant specifications of APIs and/or network protocols. This work has four primary purposes:

  - Improve security and privacy of communication between browsers and server-capable devices.
  - Enable web applications in secure contexts to communicate with server-capable devices in local network via XMLHttpRequest, Fetch API, and WebSocket.
  - Enable service discovery mechanisms to advertise existence of TLS-enabled server-capable devices.
  - Encourage adoption and implementation of the specification by browser vendors and device manufacturers.

  Given wider support and adequate stability, we plan to migrate the proposals generated in this Community Group to an appropriate standards track, for example the IETF Standards Track or a W3C Working Group, for further contributions and formal standardization.

  Created on 14 September 2016 <span class="participants" data-participants="29">(29 participants)</span>

  The mission of this group is to establish a standard for creating a universally verifiable proof of any data, file, or series of events, by anchoring data to the blockchain and other sources. This allows anyone to prove the data existed at a point in time and has not been modified.

  The group will publish and formalize the [Chainpoint specification](http://www.chainpoint.org/) as a stable reference, maintain a test suite, and take feedback and use cases for the future evolution for the specification.

  The Chainpoint Community Group will coordinate with the [Blockchain Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/blockchain/) for general standardization of blockchain-related technology, and will operate according to the [Chainpoint CG charter](http://www.chainpoint.org/w3c_chainpoint_charter.html). You can read more about Chainpoint, its history, and goals, on our [recent blog post announcing Chainpoint 2.0](https://medium.com/@WayneVaughan/chainpoint-a-standard-blockchain-proof-protocol-79def1c37189#.ayikplbdw).

  This group invites participants who are actively developing and deploying proof-of-existence, timestamping, and data integrity solutions, who are skilled in blockchain technologies, and who can work on use cases for Chainpoint and related technologies.

  Created on 6 September 2016 <span class="participants" data-participants="44">(44 participants)</span>

  Media web application developers want to deploy their content on a wide and heterogeneous range of devices and platforms, e.g. televisions, set-top boxes, and mobile devices. To ensure a smooth user experience across devices, these user agents need to support a minimum set of Web technologies that developers can rely on being supported. This Community Group plans to specify such a set of Web technologies and additionally plans to provide guidance for developers and implementers e.g. on performance constraints and portability issues.

  The "SPARQL Maintenance (EXISTS)" Community Group is a forum to discuss and address problems with the "EXISTS" feature in SPARQL 1.1. The [SPARQL 1.1 suite of specifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) and the [SPARQL 1.1 test suite](https://www.w3.org/2009/sparql/docs/tests/) are frozen. A process exists to record errata and that will be one input to any working group chartered to revise SPARQL. In the meantime, SPARQL is being used in real-work systems in industry and public-sector. The user community expects a high degree of conformance across implementations. The EXISTS feature has been found to be problematic. This feature is used by the [RDF Data Shapes Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2014/data-shapes/). This community group will create CG Notes and accompanying test suites to describe one or more improvements with an emphasis on maintaining compatibility. This group is not producing specifications. Any tests produced by the will submitted to the [RDF Test Suite Curation CG](https://www.w3.org/community/rdf-tests/) for long-term stewardship.

  Created on 1 June 2016 <span class="participants" data-participants="33">(33 participants)</span>

  The goal of this group is to 1) identify application areas in which the combined processing of XML and RDF data and tooling is beneficial; 2) identify issues that hinder the joint usage of the two technology stacks 3) formulate best practices to resolve the issues or propose standardization topics. The goal does not only take into account the data representation formats XML and RDF, but all related technologies (e.g. for XML: XSLT, XQuery; for RDF: RDF Schema, SPARQL) and selected XML (e.g. OData) or RDF vocabularies. The group should be driven by needs of industries that already deploy one or both technology stacks. This will also cover adjacent technologies like JSON with respect to the topics covered in this group. The outcome should focus not on a big architecture of how to work with XML and RDF, but on small building blocks (as best practices or standardization topics) that can be re-used across industries and application scenarios.

- ## <a href="/community/wwca/" id="wwca">Web We Can Afford</a>

  Created on 22 January 2016 <span class="participants" data-participants="60">(60 participants)</span>

  Most scientists now seem to agree that we've entered a new epoch dubbed the "Anthropocene", where the environmental consequences of human development have a tremendous impact on Earth's equilibrium. Those effects are already set in motion and will have far-reaching consequences in the coming years despite all the measures we could take to mitigate them (considering we simply do not fail to take action). While trying to avoid some of the consequences of the Anthropocene is an issue that is well-worth striving for, another task would be to reconsider the design of things at the time of the Anthropocene and that includes the Web. For instance, a 2008 study by the University of Dresden stated that if no measure was taken, the energy needed to power the infrastructure of the Web in 2030 would be tantamount to the energy consumed by humanity in 2008. The agendas of the stakeholders who are trying to set the Web forward in motion are mainly focused on adding new technological layers to the existing ones. Yet, the logic behind these developments remains that of tapping into unlimited resources, not limited ones. Lots of endeavors are currently focused on reshaping the Web into a "Web we want", a redecentralized open Web fit for an enlightened digital age. Those who advocate such an agenda and those who oppose it generally both share a common assumption: that enlightened or not, the future will be even more digital than the present. Yet, life at the time of the Anthropocene, at least in the coming decades, might not remain as pervasively digital as it is today. Other efforts that see the ongoing battle for the decentralization of the Web as an opportunity to “downscale” it (in particular in Africa) seem to be aware of that. Maybe it's time to take into account other perspectives on the future and concretely act towards building a sustain-able (Tony Fry) Web. In other words, a Web We Can Afford. This group would like to reconcile the development of the Web and an awareness to the environmental issues by appealing to Web architects and designers, eco-designers, activists, philosophers, social scientists, etc., so as to make the issue a public one to begin with, before devising a set of guidelines as a first step towards concrete action.

  Created on 17 November 2015 <span class="participants" data-participants="14">(14 participants)</span>

  W3C provide a great variety of standards that can be used to build applications that use the Internet as a platform for communication and integration. The open Knowledge-driven Service-oriented System architectures and APIs (KiSS) community group is created for sharing, elaborating and evolving knowledge-driven approaches for system integration. The KiSS community group takes service-oriented architecture as a main paradigm for application creation. However, it is not enough to say that there is a set of some services that can be integrated according to the application needs. The integration is facilitated with semantic descriptions of the services. Furthermore, the special support components are required at system run time in order to allow dynamic composition of the services accordingly semantic representation of adjusted or new system goals. Thus, the community aims to categorise different possible architectures to allow knowledge-driven approach for system integration; it provides reference architectures that also point out possible technologies for the solution implementation. The community targets different application domains and industries in order to benefit from cross-domain vision on development of knowledge-driven systems. The abbreviation of the community group highlights the integrative nature of the group (small i among K (knowledge), S (service) and S (system)). The group is managed by 6 re-electable chairs. The roles and responsibilities of the chairs go as follows:

  - General chair: Ideologist. Overall synchronization between different pillars of the KiSS. PR with other groups and external stakeholders. Member attraction, community group development.
  - Chair for integration: Integration technologies, web service composition.
  - Chair for knowledge: Knowledge representation and reasoning standards and methodologies.
  - Chair for devices: Embedded devices, their adoption for KiSS.
  - Chair for services: Web services, standards, methodologies for service definition.
  - Chair for application domains: KiSS in different application domains. Cross-domain learning and development. Benchmarking.

  The complexity of machines and software has grown dramatically in the past years. The technical documentation became a fundamental source for service technicians and professionals in their daily work. Fast and focused access methods are necessary to handle massive volumes of technical documents. Semantic technologies have proven their ability to improve accessibility of information (see Linked Open Data). However, existing corpora of technical documents are usually not semantically prepared. This group shall focus on applying semantic technologies to technical documentation. All peers (individuals or projects) can state their needs (input) and offers (output).

  This group represents a collaborative, community effort with a mission to develop, maintain, and promote standard schemas for data mining and machine learning algorithms, datasets, and experiments. Our target is a community agreed schema as a basis for ontology development projects, markup languages and data exchange standards; and an extension model for the schema in the area of data mining and machine learning. The goals of this group are: To define a simple shared schema of data mining/ machine learning (DM/ML) algorithms, datasets, and experiments that may be used in many different formats: XML, RDF, OWL, spreadsheet tables. Collect use cases from the academic community and industry Use this schema as a basis to align existing DM/ML ontologies and develop more specific ontologies with specific purposes/applications Prevent a proliferation of incompatible DM/ML ontologies Turn machine learning algorithms and results into linked open data Promote the use of this schema, including involving stakeholders like ML tool developers Apply for funding (e.g. EU COST, UK Research Councils, Horizon2020 Coordination and Support Actions) to organize workshops, and for dissemination

  Created on 4 September 2015 <span class="participants" data-participants="20">(20 participants)</span>

  The purpose of this group is to provide a home for the test suites and implementation reports of various Semantic Web/Linked Data specifications. After the end of a working group, the test suites often become frozen, and it is difficult to add new tests for issues that come to light later on. Similarly, some specs are implemented on a base technology, which eventually evolves (e.g. SPARQL 1.1 and RDF 1.1), and developers need access to updated tests. This group will create a home for forks of the various test suites that would be appropriate to act as a redirect for existing tests. Test updates will be considered based on the consensus of those invested in the related specifications. Implementation reports can be updated as new reports are received, giving implementations visibility. This group will not publish Specifications.

The group should leverage existing work in the area of sport vocabularies, thinking globally with a focus on supporting the 'head' of sports vocabularies while keeping in mind the 'body' and 'tail'.

  ### An attempt to find ways of using stroke fonts in design workflows

  A stroked font is based on the idea of describing a collection of glyphs by their center line or the movement of a pen rather than their outlines. The center line, or skeleton, would then be styled either from inside the font, either from any software that acts downstream on the text, according to parameters that are yet to be defined. But might be based on the concept of an object following a path. This could be a very different approach than those embedded in the font formats currently in wide use. There will be a lot of issues to address for this to move forward. Drawing letters from their skeleton allow users for other styling options, but also allows the computer for a larger understanding of a glyphs shape as a whole or it's important features, regions, parts. Based on this understanding it woud be easier to algorithmically alter these glyphs' shapes -- while composing texts for example. It would enlarge the scope of what this group aims to do. Going towards a parametric approach of designing fonts, and considering the resulting transformation of the composition process. From fonts to lettering, from typography to writing. We aim to discover, adapt or develop a way to make these fonts usable and stylable in a variety of scenarios, such as web pages, canvas based design tools, as well as pen plotters, CNC, PCP and cartography design environments.

- ## <a href="/community/linkedculture/" id="linkedculture">Exposing and Linking Cultural Heritage data</a>

  Created on 4 June 2015 <span class="participants" data-participants="20">(20 participants)</span>

  The wealth of data about cultural heritage collections held within archives world-wide is of great interest for humanities research and education activities. Yet this data is too often hard to find, created in isolated silos and poorly documented. Large projects such as RES (https://bbcarchdev.github.io/res/) , HuNI (https://huni.net.au), Europeana (http://www.europeana.eu) and CLARIAH (http://www.clariah.nl/) express a clear need for making that data easier to find, link and consume. The mission of this community group is to discuss which standards are needed to facilitate this process. The aim is to produce recommendations for cultural heritage data exposure using the work of RES, HuNI, Europeana and CLARIAH as a starting point.

  Created on 10 April 2015 <span class="participants" data-participants="133">(133 participants)</span>

  Accessibility is often provided through accommodations. Schools are legally obligated to provide accommodations to enrolled students with identified disabilities, based on their needs—sign language interpreters in lectures for deaf students, digital copies of textbooks for students who are blind or have reading difficulties, extended time on exams for students who need more time due to cognitive or physical disabilities.

  With online learning, the obligations are less clear—for example, with MOOCs, where students around the world are taking courses but are not enrolled at the sponsoring school or organization. Also, accommodations are not well established—sign language interpreters and note takers are typically accommodations for the physical classroom. How does an organization ensure they are meeting obligations and giving online students the support they need participate fully and to be successful?

  Providers of online learning are best off delivering courses that are accessible out-of-the-box, without the need for special accommodations. And many of the features that provide an accessible experience for people with disabilities benefit all learners. For example, lecture transcripts are an excellent tool for study and review. However, without deliberate attention to the technologies, standards, and guidelines that comprise the Web Platform, accessibility may be difficult to achieve, and learners with disabilities may be left behind.

  The activities of the Accessible Online Learning W3C Community Group take place at the intersection of accessibility and online learning. We focus on reviewing current W3C resources and technologies to ensure the requirements for accessible online learning experiences are considered. We also identify areas where additional resources and technologies are needed to ensure full participation of people with disabilities in online learning experiences.

  Created on 3 February 2015 <span class="participants" data-participants="26">(26 participants)</span>

  Timing mechanisms allow operations to be executed at the correct time. The Web already has several mechanisms supporting timed operations, including setTimeout and setInterval, as well as controllers for media frameworks and animations. However, the Web lacks support for multi-device timing. A multi-device timing mechanism would allow timed operations across Web pages hosted by different devices. Multi-device timing is particularly important for the broadcasting industry, as it is the key enabler for web-based secondary device offerings. More generally, multi-device timing has wide utility in communication, collaboration and multi-screen presentation. This Community Group aims to define a common, multi-device, timing mechanism and a practical programming model. This will improve the Web as a platform for time-sensitive, multi-device Web applications. Charter : http://webtiming.github.io

- ## <a href="/community/trustperms/" id="trustperms">Trust &amp; Permissions</a>

  Created on 15 January 2015 <span class="participants" data-participants="10">(10 participants)</span>

  As the Open Web Platform expands, and apps are developed that access various sensitive resources, new ways of managing permissions to access these resources are likely to arise. This Community Group will explore and evaluate such ways based upon experience with native and hybrid platforms, and drawing upon research studies. This follows on from the Paris meeting on trust and permissions held on 3-4 September 2014, see \[1\]. Resources vary in sensitivity and timeliness, e.g. when and to whom a password should be disclosed is quite different from when access to the user’s webcam should be granted. Similarly, modes of obtaining user permission vary, including asking users upfront for permission when an app is installed or first run (exemplified in Android and Windows) or asking users for permission when the application is attempting to use a given capability (exemplified in iOS) and permission can even be obtained after the fact by inviting the user to continue or to cancel an action after it has occurred, i.e. asking for forgiveness rather than permission. In some cases, the user's actions can be taken as implicitly granting permission, such as the Windows file chooser dialog. A further approach is for users to delegate decisions on permissions to a trusted 3rd party. The goal of this CG is to develop and articulate best practices for which modes of obtaining permission best match which resource types, and make these best practices available to both platform developers (browser and operating system vendors) and app developers. Ideally the APIs offered to apps to obtain permission to access resources should be consistent across platforms, while allowing platforms the flexibility to present a user experience that meets each platform’s needs. The scope of this Community Group is limited to discussion and guidance on best practices, to review draft APIs from individual WG's, and pre-standardization work on promising ideas for better user experience obtaining permission, including trusted UI and trust delegation per Roesner et al, see \[2\]. Work on best practices will focus on the kinds of resources that need protection, the enumeration of good ways to obtain user permission, to dis-recommend permission models that are known to be problematic, and to recommend the preferred user experience for a given kind of resource. The main focus is on the Open Web Platform, but packaged apps are not excluded.

  Created on 27 November 2014 <span class="participants" data-participants="20">(20 participants)</span>

  The aim of our project is to build new HTML5 specifications that can be used later by developers who wish to create more accessible websites for colour-blind people. The goal is that the specifications, that we are going to suggest, will one day become a standard of HTML5. According to WHO, 246 million people worldwide, whilst not being blind, suffer from moderate or severe visual impairment. This includes various forms of colour blindness and other visual deficiencies such as glaucoma and cataract. Just like everyone else, colour-blind people use the Internet for professional and private purposes. However, they often encounter accessibility problems. Our challenge is to improve their situation by providing easy-to-use HTML5 specifications to developers. To understand, define and bring solutions to colour-blind people who interact with web interfaces, we are going to conduct user tests with them based on the eye tracking technology. This will allow us to define a corpus of usability rules, according to the level of deficiency of the colour-blind persons. These rules will help us to develop solutions, validate them with other user tests and later develop HTML5 specifications that can be used in CSS. The challenge is not only helping developers with easy-to-use HTML5 markups, but also make them aware of the situation and together build a better Internet with more accessible websites. Feel free to join this group if you: \* are suffering from colour-blindness \* or have field experience developing accessibility solutions for the colour-blind or other visual impairment \* or have experience working with a previous submission to the W3C.

  This community group will discuss the applications of web browsers as the computer for controlling robots (robotics, in other words). And it will be also intended to feedback knowledge obtained from this discussion to standardization activity about Web of Things.

  What kinds of values are contained in using a Web browser not only in drawing graphical user interface but also in controlling and manipulating robots, and what kinds of difficulties and problems are there in that case? To search their answers may become the driving force of this activity.

  As an example, there may be the following questions in the discussion:

  - Is a case applying a Web browser as a simple controller of the robots which does not have UI such as screens or the pointing devices still meaningful? For example, connectivity with web services and interlocking operation between robots (Swarm Robotics via web) may be one of its values.
  - Is it possible to relate a graphical user interface of HTML to interactive and physical user interface of the robots? Is it meaningful? As an example, a relation between a physical push button and 'input' type="button" element in the HTML may deserve considering.
  - Are cases using relatively low-level interface used in many robots such as PWM of the motor, digital or analog signal interfaces, I2C, SPI, UART and GPIOs by the application on the web browsers meaningful?
  - Is real-time computing at the same level as RTOS feasible on the web browser-based general-purpose computing environments?

  An initial related activity is the Mozilla Factory Open Hardware Project.

  Furthermore, this group may publish specifications based on those knowledge such as webGPIO, webI2C API and so on.

  Created on 25 May 2014 <span class="participants" data-participants="12">(12 participants)</span>

  The major browsers provide users with a means of synchronizing their data across browser instances, but the services behind that synchronization process are not controlled by users, and users don't have the ability to sync the data of their choice, or sync with other browsers. Our goal is to create a specification for a browser sync process that gives users more control over their data, gives developers the ability to sync specific data for their web applications, and allows for a diverse marketplace of sync backend providers.

  Created on 24 April 2014 <span class="participants" data-participants="43">(43 participants)</span>

  The convergence of Internet-based IPTV, Video-on-Demand (VoD), Personal Video, IP multicasting video, cellular multicasting video etc. with traditional broadcasting video, satellite video and cable video is emerging on market. The technology gap between web apps and native apps is rapidly narrowing. Thus a web-based application controlling various TV channels with detailed information regarding TV programs is becoming a more and more main stream TV control application for the integrated video service. Furthermore, in many regions TV broadcasters are developing web applications that can overlay their channel in a hybrid broadcast/broadband environment. Scope of Work The W3C TV Control API Community Group is to define an API layer that is agnostic of any underlying video sourcing technologies to enable a web-based application to: - provide EPG information, including the list of TV programs and related information such as channel number, producers, directors, actors, synopsis, rating etc., - control and switch the TV sourcing based on channel identifier from EPG data - interact with TV platform for presenting the TV program appropriately - interact with TV platform for presenting other supplemental content appropriately The underlying video sourcing method and technologies, the presentation technology and/or presentation application of TV program and supplemental content are all out of scope. Operating Guidelines This group operates under the rules of the Community and Business Group Process. All matters relating to intellectual property are governed by the Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA). All participants within this group agree that their discussions will follow the General Communications Policies.

  Created on 18 February 2014 <span class="participants" data-participants="64">(64 participants)</span>

  The mission of this group is to produce a specification that describes how Web and Linked Data applications can be built using declarative technologies only, minimizing the need for source code. Current software development models involve writing source code (mostly in imperative languages) and building programs from it. Source code is prone to bugs, and managing it requires developers. The declarative approach is instead to push as much application logic from source code to data, so that the application can be managed and reused as data itself, while the software become generic and application-independent. This approach is related to functional languages and to processing pipelines. The generic software works as a processor: it takes the incoming request and the declarative application description and runs it through a pipeline, first retrieving the state of the requested resource (or changing it) and then rendering it into the requested format, such as a Web page. This is similar to an XSLT processor transforming XML documents. Graphity is a production-level platform for declarative end-user Linked Data applications with an RDF triplestore backend. It processes ontologies describing application structure, which seemlesly combine multiple declarative technolgies: URI templates, SPIN SPARQL templates, XSLT stylesheets (both server- and client-side), and RDF/POST encoding. Please join this group if you're interested in any practical or theoretical aspects of Linked Data, declarative technologies, or Graphity software.

- ## <a href="/community/propertygraphs/" id="propertygraphs">Property Graphs Model and API</a>

  Created on 19 September 2013 <span class="participants" data-participants="21">(21 participants)</span>

  This group will explore the Property Graph data model and API and decide whether this area is ripe for standardization. Property Graphs are used to analyze social networks and in other Big Data applications using NoSQL databases. The group may want to investigate several extensions to the data model. For example, should nodes be typed; what datatypes are allowed for property values; can properties have multiple values and should we add collection types such as sets and maps to the data model? At the same time, we need to bear in mind that there are several Property Graph vendors and implementations and we may not want to deviate significantly from current practice. Existing Property Graph APIs are either navigational e.g. Tinkerpop or declarative e.g. Neo4j. For a W3C standard we may want to design a more HTTP and REST-oriented interface in the style of OData Protocol and OData URL Conventions. In this style, you construct URls for collections of nodes and edges. For example, a GET on http://server/nodes would return the collection of nodes on the server. A GET on http://server/nodes/in(type = ‘knows’ ) would return the collection of incoming arcs with type = ‘knows’ and a GET on http://server/nodes/out(type = ‘created’ ) would return the collection of outgoing arcs with type = ‘created’. Once a collection of nodes or arcs is selected with the URI, query operators can be used to add functions to select properties to be returned. Functions can also be used to return aggregate properties such as count and average. The group will deliver a recommendation to the W3C regarding whether and how the Property Graph work should be taken forward towards standardization.

The data model will include agreed categories and fields that may contain content-specific information. The proposal is planned to include a documentation, code snippet examples and probable queries to support implementing the data model in existing age classification contexts. The data model proposal and the documentation are planned to serve as guidelines for either existing players to implement the data model in their existing schemes (and thus providing users additional information in an interoperable way) or for new players that plan to label online content and thus reduce the risk of sunk costs.

  Created on 26 June 2013 <span class="participants" data-participants="23">(23 participants)</span>

  People are looking to use applications and services on a ubiquitous range of devices. For developers, this raises the challenge of tailoring the user experience according to the device and context in which it is used. Application development teams involve a wide range of roles and skills: business requirements, information systems, usability and accessibility, graphical design and brand management, as well as the expertise required for specific target platforms. This Community Group seeks to bring together developers and researchers to explore and promote techniques for context aware design that separates out different aspects of design to speed development and reduce costs. We will do this through gathering and discussing techniques, together with developing open source demonstrators.

- ## <a href="/community/webappscp/" id="webappscp">Web App Source Code Protection</a>

  Created on 5 June 2013 <span class="participants" data-participants="16">(16 participants)</span>

  The goal of this community group is to explore solutions for protecting web app source codes. It is well-known that web page source codes are visible to the public due to the openness of the Internet and the W3C standards. With the advent of HTML5, the web apps become popular, especially the mobile web apps. Web apps can be classified as either Hosted App or Packaged App. The source code of Packaged Apps (such as the apps in Firefox OS or Tizen OS) are installed and running locally. Users can easily view the source code. Similarly front end source code of Hosted App can also be easily seen by anyone. In this case, the publicity of source codes becomes a problem. Because web developers never hope their web apps are easily copied by others. Therefore, this group intends to find mechanisms of code protection for web apps, especially for packaged apps, making the source codes (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript), as well as relevant resource files (image, audio and video, etc.) cannot be seen easily. Thus, the interests of web developers will be protected.

  Argument-Representation's mission is to recommend a standardized representation for formal argument. It is not intended to augment XML in any other way. The group does not necessarily commit to creating a novel representation. For instance, after due consideration it could endorse an existing one or recommend accepting an existing one with minor changes. Formal argument means a formalizable set of connected statements or statement-like objects intended to establish a proposition.

- ## <a href="/community/opened/" id="opened">Open Linked Education</a>

  Created on 21 March 2013 <span class="participants" data-participants="64">(64 participants)</span>

  As a burgeoning and emerging area, open linked data for education is currently experiencing momentum across several initiatives and organisations including Open Education, LinkedUp, LinkedUniversities or LinkedEducation., and the Open Knowledge Foundation, to name just a few. We believe that we are now at a time when these efforts should converge, with this group representing a focus point for the community to collect, capture and adopt the practices that are going to be the foundation of the web of educational data. We therefore set the following set of goals for this group: 1. To collect from existing initiatives the practices currently used to share education-related data on the web. This includes the vocabularies that are employed as well as the ways in which common aspects of the data are being modelled with these vocabularies (e.g.course catalogues, resources, university facilities, research results). Further statistical analysis can provide sound guidance on vocabulary usage within the educational Web of data. 2. To identify common, best practices amongst those and document them (including concrete examples). 3. To facilitate the adoption of these common best practices, through direct interaction with community stakeholders, as well as through showing the benefits of the reuse of data modelling practices in application developments. While this has some similarities with the idea of “creating an ontology of education”, it is not what we are aiming to achieve. Education is very broad, and our goal is therefore rather to provide common “patterns” that use existing vocabularies for the representation of common education-related data. We do expect this to create resources of interest whenever our efforts will contribute to filling a gap, and to refer to other of such resources (such as LRMI for learning resources) in other cases. This group will not publish specifications.

- ## <a href="/community/interative-apis/" id="interative-apis">Interactive APIs</a>

  Created on 26 February 2013 <span class="participants" data-participants="16">(16 participants)</span>

  The goal of the Interactive API Community Group is to develop an HTML annotation approach - similar in spirit and style to micro-formats - to equip a piece of UI (e.g., parts of a web page, such as a table or a sub-area) with a programmable interface (API). That is, the goal is to equip pieces of UI with dynamic and programmable behavior, so as to foster reuse on the Web and enable a set of web-based integration scenarios that are currently more the result of hacking and less of principled software development: programmatically operating UIs, extracting data, extracting application logic, and cloning pieces of UIs. The intuition is to design a new type of interpreted API, the so-called interactive API (iAPI), that enables (i) programmatic access to UIs and (ii) interactive, live programming. The purpose of iAPIs is not merely to provide access to static content inside a web page, but rather to bridge between the Surface Web (the UIs) and the Deep Web (common web APIs and web services). The concrete results this Group aims to produce are therefore: - An HTML annotation format for the specification of iAPIs; - An set of programming abstractions and code libraries for iAPI programming; and - A set of supporting browser extensions for iAPI parsing and instantiation. The final vision is twofold: first, to found a programming paradigm based on the reuse of UIs, i.e., UI-oriented computing; second, to enable interactive, live reuse to non-programmers directly inside the web browser.

  The mission of SVG Mapping Community Group (SVGMapCG) is to build requirements for SVG based Web Mapping through a discussion of use cases regarding map services. One of the key technologies for SVG Web Mapping is dynamic Tiling & Layering, which realizes zoom and pan display of maps in an efficient manner. The other technologies for the mapping (e.g. Shared Path, Vector Effects and etc.) are also necessary. Although these functionalities will be standardized as part of SVG 2 in SVG WG, the focus of discussion is for general use and the discussion may lack particular aspects for map services. Therefore, our main scope is to investigate whether these generic functions are enough or not to resolve challenges inherent in mapping, and to provide WGs (e.g. SVG and Geolocation) feedback from our observation. Envisioned issues for Web Mapping are a common coordinate system for map contents and a projection. Another issue is a relationship to other GIS communities (OpenLayers, Open Street Map, WMS, and etc.) outside W3C. They have developed map-related standards and frameworks, and we need to clarify our interrelationship and consider collaboration if necessary. This group will not create specifications.

  There have been several recent efforts to standardize vocabularies for describing locations, using existing geometry specifications. GeoSPARQL, NeoGeo and the EU ISA Programme's Location Core Vocabulary join schema.org's vocabulary and more. Is there a set of use cases that an usefully be served by greater collaboration in this space? What problems remain? Where are the awkward edges that need to be knocked into shape? The mission of the Location and Addresses Community Group is to review the existing efforts in this space (notably GeoSPARQL, NeoGeo, the EU's INSPIRE Directive and schema.org) and assess whether any use cases would be served by harmonization and/or new standardization work. This group may produce specifications or use cases and requirements documents, which may be proposed for adoption by the Government Linked Data (GLD) Working Group consistent with its charter (http://www.w3.org/2011/gld/charter).

  Created on 11 May 2012 <span class="participants" data-participants="35">(35 participants)</span>

  REST seven's rule was "Code on Demand," meaning the ability for the server to deliver code able to run on the client. Some, to use the same code everywhere, tried to do it with Java, .NET (ActiveX). Today, even Flash is fading out to let this place to JavaScript. HTML5 and offline support contributed in the creation of a bunch of APIs which only made sense on server-side in first place: File/FileSystem, Workers, Sockets, Storage/Session, Blob, ImageData. Most of those APIs, and even the already existing XMLHttpRequest (now in version 2) have been designed from the beginning to be usable via either synchronous or asynchronous APIs from the very early stages (synchronous is not blocking any more the user interface in browsers when used in workers). Now that the Server-Side JavaScript is rising again either in synchronous and asynchronous implementations, it is time, if we really want interoperable code/libraries/modules, to make those APIs taking into account the server-side context, and then on the other end, to push Server-Side JavaScript implementations to support them. CommonJS started a great project, it is now time to make its ambitions real.

  Since the launch of Apple's App Store in 2008, developers found a market delivery channel that greatly reduced time-to-market and time-to-payment and provided a direct channel to consumers. The result: users started buying more and more smartphones, accessing app stores and downloading billions upon billions of apps. At same reason, web developers are also expressing interest in an app store model for the Web that would enable them to get paid for their efforts without having to abandon Web development in exchange for proprietary silos. The purpose for this Web Application Store community group is to discuss about the web application store, related technologies, and various issues for Open Web Application Store. This Web Application Store CG's activities include: \* Tracking specifications and implementations related to Web Application Store. \* Refining use cases to communicate specific needs of Web Application Store. \* Discussing technological issues related to Web Apps & Web Application Store \* Suggesting refinements or fixes to existing specifications to better meet the needs of the Web Application Development community \* Evangelizing specifications to browser vendors. \* Documenting how to best use open web standards for Web Application Store \* Evangelizing open web standards and best practices for Web Application Store Anyone can join the Web Application Store Community Group.

  Created on 16 March 2012 <span class="participants" data-participants="54">(54 participants)</span>

  The sister organisation of W3C, the Web Science Trust (www.webscience.org) proposes to create a global "Web Observatory". The Open Data movement and the Transparency Agenda are successfully advocating the release of very large institutional and commercial data sets describing social phenomena, economic indicators and geographic trends. This proliferation of data represents great opportunity for researchers and industry but this data abundance also threatens to make it ever more difficult to locate, analyse, compare and interpret useful information in a consistent and reliable way; a situation which can only get worse unless we can help stakeholders perform useful analysis rather than drowning in a sea of data. The Web Observatory will offer an institutional framework to promote the use of W3C and other standards in the development of; Semantic Catalogues to globally locate existing data sets, Collection Systems to gather new global data sets, and Analytics Tools and methodologies to analyse these data sets. This community group seeks to articulate the business and technical requirements for the Web Observatory.

  Created on 14 March 2012 <span class="participants" data-participants="25">(25 participants)</span>

  Currently, more and more services are created on the web and require information about you, me, all of us. Therefore, users have to give away a lot of information about themselves to many different services. The point is that the users lose control of their identity on the web, by filling a lot of forms (e.g., through subscriptions). Privacy on the Internet is extremely important and must remain. Personal information is used by services we, sometimes, don't even know about, and it is a real problem. The aim of this group would be to think about new ways to identify individuals over the internet using trusted web based identities embedded directly into the core protocols of the web. At the same time it is important to maintain equilibrium between total privacy and providing information when needed, which means, when the user wants to.

  The group will discuss and tentatively specify a format for representing decisions, i.e. decision information, so they can be used across diverse systems. Because of the great variety of applications and decision technologies, this format should focus on the generic, core components of decisions and decision-making information. Decisions are a source of information in themselves, i.e. each decision that is made is in itself a piece of information the may need to be stored, tracked, shared, combined and compared to other decisions. The same holds for information about the decision process. In particular, this group will discuss and study how Semantic Web technologies can facilitate the representation and sharing of decision information. Ultimately, the aim of the group is to study and develop technologies and methods to support better, rapid, and agile decision making.

  Welcome to the W3C Community Group for Network Friendly applications! In this group, we are looking for contributions to help us reach the widest possible consensus in a critical area facing the mobile industry. Smartphones and smartphone applications have established themselves as a major success story in the industry over the past few years. As the number of smartphones and smartphone applications has increased the industry has learnt much on how to create efficient applications for smartphones. The GSMA has created a set of guidelines for application developers that will enable improvements across a number of areas including application connectivity, power consumption, network reliability and security. By following these guidelines - Developers will be better equipped to create fit-for-purpose apps - Users will experience more responsive and reliable apps and improved battery life - Mobile operators will see a reduced strain on their networks For a copy of these guidelines check out http://www.gsma.com/go/download/file=gsmasmarterappsforsmarterphones0112v.0.14.pdf GSMA intends to issue an update of the above document by end of 2012. As such, it has compiled a list of items for inclusion in the update after consulting GSMA’s members; they include network operators and device manufactures. To ensure the new update will have the widest possible support by all communities across the industry, we have created a Community Group called ‘network friendly Developer guidelines’ under auspices of W3C. The new CG is formed with a view to engage other developers or interested parties and reach a consensus as what needs to be added beyond what has already been proposed by GSMA. The proposed items for inclusion are embedded in this document. Check out http://www.w3.org/community/networkfriendly/wiki/images/b/be/Proposed\_items\_for\_inclusion\_in\_the\_update.doc to download the current suggestions as approved by GSMA. As the update will be released by end of 2012, all changes should be agreed in time before the actual work of writing and editing the document starts in earnest and no later than 1st September 2012. That means the outcome of activities in the CG would be a list of items for inclusion beyond what has already been proposed by GSMA. The outcome would be considered by GSMA for inclusion when updating the document. In Brief, the goal and milestones to bear in mind are as follows. Goal To produce a set of items for inclusion in the updated document beyond what has already been suggested (see the enclosed document) Key milestones 19th April to 10th August 2012 to discuss the base document and the proposed updates and reach consensus in the CG on any additional proposals 11th August to 18th August is the cooling off period to take on board last minute suggestions and final touches 19th August to 31st August, GSMA will consider the final input from CG prior to commencing work on the update in September As a rule of thumb, the entire process would be transparent and inclusive to reach agreement by discussion. In the unlikely event of not reaching consensus on burning issues, the (yet to be named) CG chair would make the final decision only as a last resort. You are invited to actively engage with the process to make the resulting document much better than its debut version. We welcome views and contribution with an open mind.

  The Data Driven Standards Community Group focuses on researching, analyzing and publicly documenting current usage patterns on the Internet. Inspired by the Microformats Process, the goal of this group is to enlighten standards development with real-world data. This group will collect and report data from large Web crawls, produce detailed reports on protocol usage across the Internet, document yearly changes in usage patterns and promote findings that demonstrate that the current direction of a particular specification should be changed based on publicly available data. All data, research, and analysis will be made publicly available to ensure the scientific rigor of the findings. The group will be a collection of search engine companies, academic researchers, hobbyists, protocol designers and specification editors in search of data that will guide the Internet toward a brighter future.

  A number of organisations are now working with the TTML specification, and a degree of parallel discussion is happening. Some of that discussion is behind closed doors. There is a need to cross fertilize such groups so that the standard does not diverge, in addition new features and errata are being developed. This group is established to act as a forum for individuals, companies and consortia that are working with the TTML specification to address such issues. The core activities of the group will be as follows: - To act as a central forum for technical questions and answers on TTML - To act as a point of coordination for extensions and features being created in other organizations. - To identify issues, gaps and errata in the specification for future standardization. - Support the Timed Text Working Group (TTWG)) to develop a community standard which updates TTML 1.0 to address issues, gaps, and errata. - To develop and document tutorials, examples and best practice workflows - To host example code, templates, test data, and implementation code

  This community group is focused on bringing high performance computing (HPC) to the web. In particular, we're interested in making the computing and data resources that underlie simulation science, scientific computing, and data-centric science easily accessible through web browsers. Our members are working on APIs that expose HPC resources via the web, as well as gateways and web applications that take advantage of these APIs. The major goal of this community is to accelerate the pace of development of web-based HPC applications. Recognizing that we can build on each other's work, and that a consistent approach to developing such tools can enable features that require communication across multiple computing centers, we are interested in sharing technologies and ideas.

  Created on 19 August 2011 <span class="participants" data-participants="113">(113 participants)</span>

  The W3C Augmented Reality Community Group is an open forum for collaborative discussions about the intersection of Augmented Reality and the Web, or more simply the Augmented Web. This forum welcomes discussions about related standards, the standardisation process, related market developments and the broader social implications of this new generation of the web.

  We believe that the Augmented Web brings a unique perspective that pushes standards, APIs, hardware technologies and the broader web platform to the edge of their performance limits. The Augmented Web embraces the changes brought about by HTML5 and other related standards including Geolocation, DeviceOrientation, DeviceMotion, WebGL, Web Audio, Media Capture & Streams and WebRTC. The Augmented Web integrates all of these disparate technologies into an integrated new vision of the web.

  This group will not produce specifications.

  Instead it aims to build an integrated community voice that reaches out to all of the other relevant working groups and standards bodies to ensure that the Augmented Web perspective is clearly represented and considered. Our goal is to help ensure that the disparate standards and APIs being planned and implemented by these other groups can be seamlessly integrated into this new vision for the Augmented Web.

  The mission of the Declarative 3D for the Web Architecture Community Group is to determine the requirements, options, and use cases for an integration of interactive 3D graphics capabilities into the W3C technology stack. This group is aimed to extract core features out of the requirements as foundation to propose feasible technical solutions. These should cover the majority of 3D use cases for the Web - but not necessarily all of them. There are upcoming open (e.g., WebGL) and proprietary (e.g., Adobe) proposals for imperative graphics APIs in the Web context but we are missing an easy way to add interactive high-level declarative 3D objects to the HTML-DOM to allow anyone to easily create, share, and experience interactive 3D graphics - with possibly wide ranging effects similar to those caused by the broad availability of video on the Web. The goal of this CG is to evaluate the necessary requirements for a successful standardization of a declarative approach to interactive 3D graphics as part of HTML documents.

  The technological advancement in computational power and the significant increase in data generation allowed the successful implementation and application of many machine learning methods that were not possible before. On the one hand side, those methods need a lot of data to succeed. On the other hand side, the Semantic Web community has successfully published a large amount of machine-readable data on the Web. RDF data is often accessible over not machine-learning-ready protocols. The purpose of this community is to discuss how to leverage machine learning methods in RDF data through the SPARQL query language and protocol.

  The purpose of this group should be to discuss anything that could enhance the web and reduce its impact on environment. Discussion could be about, for example:

  - Improving efficiency of apis
  - Reducing data consumption
  - Upgrading apis to make them less greedy in energy

  Millions of kilowatts are wasted in the world each year because of various reasons, such as:

  - Bad algorithms
  - Data storing (ex : spams)
  - Wrong processes

  Any idea that could make the web more respectful for environment is welcome to this group.

  Created on 11 November 2020 <span class="participants" data-participants="12">(12 participants)</span>

  This mission of this group is to help re-establish platform interoperability between descendants of the original "High Fidelity Virtual Reality Platform" (HFVRP) open source project.

  The group will initially host discussions and coordinate volunteer research efforts in order to identify relevant areas of common ground across HFVRP projects.

  For example, it was once possible to use the "interface" client from one platform to connect to a "domain server" hosted on a similar, but different platform. As these projects have continued to evolve, the once-shared protocol version (for example) between them has fallen out of sync, inadvertently breaking the possibility of cross-connections.

  By gathering together common interest across multiple projects, this group hopes to then help collectively estimate efforts and help champion neutral sub-projects that can restore specific compatibilities.

  It is suggested that neutral community sub-projects emerging from this group adopt the permissive Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL) open source license. LGPL currently seems to align best with the mission at hand and for these reasons:

  - interoperability across diverse projects is likely to be an ongoing, multi-platform, community-driven effort -- adopting LGPL for these components can help ensure the collective community effort remains transparent and improvable across the entire project space
  - as degrees of interoperability are restored LGPL dependencies can be version-managed and upgraded per each projects typical dependency update schedules
  - LGPL is already an approved dependency license across HFVRP projects (ie: all known platforms critically depend on Qt by way of the LGPL) -- by not introducing a new license for these shared efforts, existing open source project audits can remain intact

  This effort will hopefully span across diverse project politics, technical minds, and social circles which can come together and approach compatibility as a shared effort.

  All platforms forked from the original HFVRP code base are welcome to join forces this way and in particular contributing developers, community members, and any others interested in helping broaden platform interoperability.

  Some of the low-level technology skills likely needed to restore interoperability are:

  - familiarity with HFVRP networking protocols and versioning
  - "HFM" internal model formats and corresponding C++ structures
  - overall "Oven" asset baking tool and filesystem layouts
  - Baked asset structures (materials.json, ktx, modded FBX format w/draco compression, etc.)
  - Entities "models.json.gz" world persistence format and "domain server" archive formats
  - "Avatar.fst" and internal blendshape "de facto" standards
  - "Interface" client, "domain server," and "assignment client" JSON configuration formats
  - (as common sub-projects emerge) help setting up multi-project Continuous Integration systems

  We think it will be easiest for volunteers in cases where interested projects have remained open source, but all HFVRP projects (including closed source ones) are welcome to join and suggest specific layers or features they would nonetheless be interested in seeing reemerged as a common open source dependency.

  This group will not publish Specifications.

  WEB OF PRODUCT TRACEABILITY This is the landing page for Web of Product Traceability Community Group. In the modern commercial society, product traceability is an important technical system to support the business credit of enterprises.Product traceability is also widely used in product quality supervision, modern logistics, financing Mortgage, commercial consumption and other fields. Therefore, many countries and organizations attach great importance to the development of Traceability Technology. Many independent traceability systems have been built by different countries and organizations. Uniform standards will help to improve the interconnection between them. With the development of technology, two-dimensional code has gradually replaced the commodity bar code, and the data contained in the RFID tag can reach 64K bytes, or even more.The article code based on URL is compatible with traditional GS. 1 commodity code and other coding systems.Therefore, an open product traceability network can be established from bottom to top based on WWW technology. Master data, transaction data and event data can be described by XML / JSON technology. Technologies such as Internet of things and blockchain will also play an important role in the network.The web of product traceability community is aims to build an open traceability network that can run on the public Internet.The original closed traceback network will not disappear, they can access to the open network as an autonomous domain.In the field of product traceability, there are also problems of data mining and information security. The community is aims to build various application models and interfaces to mine the value of traceability data.In order to ensure that the traceability data is not leaked, the community also needs to formulate corresponding information security standards to strictly control the access rights of traceability data. This will be a very promising and exciting work. We expect more enterprises and experts to join in and build an open traceability network.

  Created on 3 September 2020 <span class="participants" data-participants="25">(25 participants)</span>

  Performing Arts Information Representation (PAIR) is a community group dedicated to advancing the use of shared conceptual models for better data interoperability in the performing arts domain. This domain stands to gain tremendous benefit from using Semantic Web technologies as it relies on the interoperability of information across many fields such as event publishing and discovery, digital archiving, and research (to name a few). The group’s mission is to support the development and use of semantic vocabularies and common representational frameworks to ensure the meaningful sharing and aggregation of information related to the performing arts. This Community Group provides a forum for the exchange of ideas and experiences, scenarios and requirements while bringing together key stakeholders. The group will act as an advocate for representational standardization in the performing arts sector. PAIR will strive to develop mutually beneficial collaborations with groups and organizations that are actively working on relevant standards and/or implementations. In particular, the group will work to develop extensions to existing representational standards such as Schema.org and Wikidata so that Performing Arts information can be better understood by search engines and other web applications. While designing, maintaining and revising vocabularies and foundational specifications for the performing arts, the group will make efforts to involve the performing arts community at large through solicitation of requests, comments and suggestions from non PAIR members. This may take the form of symposiums, workshops, events or community curated open resources.

  Decentralized e-commerce and storefront apps will more easily share and syndicate their products rather than relying on single and proprietary APIs from hosts to operate a storefront. By structuring portable commerce data stores, protocols, and semantics, this group seeks to enable marketplaces to be built more eaily and made more easily discoverable.

  This group's efforts will complement existing activities such as Web Payments, Linked Data, and DID, to deliver a search, browse, configure, checkout, and payment workflow for physical and digital products with mostly existing web technologies.

  At a higher-level, it would be potentially beneficial to include support for an aggregate query language, (such as SPARQL) to enable applications to query a known network of compatible applications for product information to better support web resource-to-web resource indexing and listing of products, increasing visibility without the need for central search engines. This would potentially utilize HTTP methods to register product catalogs in other web apps or request product catalogs from other web apps, enabling products to be purchased outside of the scope of the original commerce site, creating an aggregate marketing power across the web rather than depending on singular, monolithic e-commerce platforms.

  The primary mission of the community group is to bring together (top companies, universities, and teams involved in digital finance technology in various industries) and frontier technology in digital finance to push forward the development to digital asset standardization.

  What is a digital asset? A digital asset is data with unique identity attributes that are binary coded, owned, or controlled by a company or individual. The data has various manifestations, including text content, images, multimedia, Computer programs, etc. Generally speaking, digital assets include websites and their content, domain names, application software, codes, electronic documents, image content, media content, electronic money, emails, game accounts, other accounts & their content, social network accounts & their relationships and cloud service accounts & their data, etc.

  The digital asset on the blockchain owns all the general attributes of digital assets above, it also has other characteristics: the computer programs registered on blockchain ledger or distributed ledger, as well as the virtual assets existed in the form of bit structure, can be programmed. The exchange of assets is essentially the exchange of code. The digital assets on the blockchain can achieve complete disintermediation of autonomous and autonomous point-to-point transactions without the need for third-party manual intervention. Once the asset is issued on the blockchain, the subsequent circulation link can be independent of the issuer’s system. As the asset circulation is changed from single-center control to socialized communication, any channel with resources can become a catalyst for asset circulation, which greatly improve the efficiency of digital asset circulation, and truly achieve the effect of "multi-party issuance and free circulation."

  To welcome the era of asset digitization, the group is formed to technically communicate and cooperate with other members, and to develop a broader market together. The problems that we are trying to solve in this group are:

  1.  Digital asset operation, trading, development, and supervision standardization;
  2.  Formation of industry alliances and specification of industry standards;
  3.  Universal education of digital assets

  The group aims to support pioneer companies that explore digital assets, encourage communication and cooperation. We are expecting deliverables such as published reports and a service platform on this basis.

  Created on 21 January 2020 <span class="participants" data-participants="15">(15 participants)</span>

  Being able to efficiently collect, analyse and leverage data insights from buildings is a catalyst for optimising building performance, improving the use of resources and moving towards predictive maintenance and buildings that can respond to the climate emergency. The lack of standardised naming and labelling for connected devices in the built environment means we are failing to leverage the value of data to allow interoperability, improve building efficiency and increase occupant productivity. A naming and labelling standard (complementing other industry initiatives) will simplify and drive consistency thus increasing value by unlocking the application of technologies such as machine learning. The work of this community group will align with and complement other initiatives in the industry such as BRICK, Haystack, Omniclass, Uniclass, IFC etc. In scope for this work are:

  - A simple specification for naming syntax
  - A register of building device names and labels

  The mission of this group is to define a common protocol for communicating with connected devices over the web, to enable ad-hoc interoperability on the [Web of Things](https://www.w3.org/WoT/). Deliverables of the group may include use cases, requirements and specifications. The group will collaborate with the W3C Web of Things Interest Group and Working Group to ensure any specifications complement or extend the “[Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description)” specification. Objectives:

  1.  Define a WebSocket sub-protocol for the Web of Things, using the W3C “Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description” data model and operations
  2.  Define an HTTP protocol binding for the Web of Things (or support the Web of Things Working Group in defining this protocol binding and ensuring consistency with the WebSocket sub-protocol where appropriate)
  3.  Evaluate other potential Web of Things protocol bindings (e.g. CoAP)

Researchers are interested in understanding the actual needs of industrial partners, gathering use cases and example data, and clarifying the challenges that further research can help address, as well as refining the methodologies for developing semantic based solutions. Industrial partners are interested in having clear benefits for adopting semantic technologies in relation to the digital transformation of industry. How can these benefits be realised by average developers using higher level frameworks and better tooling. The W3C Community Group will make extensive use of the GitHub issue tracker to raise and discuss ideas, and to prepare W3C Community Group reports with our findings.

  The mission of the Conversational Interfaces Community Group is to enable web developers to collaborate and share conversational experiences for a variety of domains. Most dialogue systems serve interactive experiences in their own domain specific language, causing a fragmented zoo of proprietary formats. For example, Google Home or Alexa do not share a common intermediate representation, which makes writing wide-spread content inaccessible to the mass audience. We study existing specs and design standards to harness proven techniques into common agreement. See the [the Community Group's charter](https://conversational-interfaces.github.io/charter/).

- ## <a href="/community/talent-signal/" id="talent-signal">Talent Marketplace Signaling</a>

  Created on 6 February 2019 <span class="participants" data-participants="36">(36 participants)</span>

  Much is said about the mismatch between the needs of employers for qualified employee candidates and a pool of available candidates. One major factor contributing to this mismatch is the signaling between the demand-side (i.e., employers) and supply-side (i.e., education, training and credentialing providers, students and workers) of the talent pipeline. This mismatch frequently results in neither party coming into view of the other. The goal of the Talent Marketplace Signaling (TalentSignal) Community Group is to assist Schema.org in improving workforce signaling by refining existing schema.org types serving the talent pipeline and suggesting new types and properties where improved signaling cannot otherwise be achieved. Currently, workforce signaling sits at the intersection of a number of existing schema.org types: Course, JobPosting, Occupation, Organization, Person and the proposed EducationalOccupationalCredential.

  The TalentSignal Community Group will focus initially on refinement of the [JobPosting Schema](https://schema.org/JobPosting) and related types as it survey's specifications from domain entities such as [HR Open Standards](https://hropenstandards.org/) and [PESC](http://www.pesc.org/home.html) as well as the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation's [Job Data Exchange (JDX)](https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/workforce-development/JDX) and [T3 Innovation Network](https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/t3-innovation) initiatives for better means to strong, more effective supply- and demand-side signaling.

  Created on 22 January 2018 <span class="participants" data-participants="9">(9 participants)</span>

  This working group is for the discussion and design of the specification of a protocol for standardized distributed ECMAScript and WebGL applications. Distributed Compute Protocol (DCP) will become the standard for distributed computing by seamlessly integrating with the internet protocol suite. DCP will be introduced on top of HTTPs/TCP/IP to transmit JSON package files for execution, transforming computational power into a public utility. The Compute Resource Allocation algorithm (CRAa) matches demand for suppliers by efficiently comparing a variety of requirements. DCP is a foundational building block for web 3.0 and is an enabler of technology including, but not limited to, allowing other distributed applications and blockchains to move to the world wide web.

  The aim of this community group is to show how educational and occupational credentials may be described with schema.org, and to propose any additional terms for schema.org that may be necessary. Educational and Occupational Credentials are defined as diplomas, academic degrees, certifications, qualifications, badges, etc., that a person can obtain through learning, education and/or training. They are typically awarded on successful completion of an assessment of relevant capabilities. See also the Connecting Credentials [glossary of credentialing terms](http://connectingcredentials.org/common-language-work-group-glossary/). Related work includes: the [Credential Transparency Description Language](https://credreg.net/ctdl/handbook) (CTDL) developed for the Credential Engine; IMS Global's [Badge Alliance](https://www.badgealliance.org/); and, the W3C [Verifiable Claims Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/). The work of this group will complement these, with a focus on integration with schema.org and on describing a credential that is being offered rather than the claim to posses one.

  Created on 13 December 2016 <span class="participants" data-participants="28">(28 participants)</span>

  A group to develop a mechanism for the automatic discovery of WebAPIs, by extending the schema.org vocabulary. Increasingly, large online platforms and services provide one or more Web APIs for third-party developers. Moreover, many companies build WebAPIs as their primary product (Email API, SMS API, etc.). This has resulted in an explosion of the number of WebAPIs in recent years. Developers spend a significant amount of time searching for suitable WebAPIs to meet their needs. Our intention is to work closely with Schema.org to define a WebAPI-specific extension and promote usage of this extension among API owners. In the long run, our aim is to contribute this extension into the core Schema.org vocabulary. To achieve these goals we are seeking feedback and collaboration from API owners, DX specialists, API description language experts and maintainers of various API catalogs.

- ## <a href="/community/mathonwebpages/" id="mathonwebpages">Getting Math onto Web Pages</a>

  Created on 13 April 2016 <span class="participants" data-participants="58">(58 participants)</span>

  We invite you to visit [the main site for this Community Group](https://w3c.github.io/mathonwebpages/) (&lt;https://w3c.github.io/mathonwebpages/&gt;)

  There are many technical issues in presenting mathematics in today's Open Web Platform, which has led to the poor access to Mathematics in Web Pages. This is in spite of the existing de jure or de facto standards for authoring mathematics, like MathML, LaTeX, or asciimath, which have been around for a very long time and are widely used by the mathematical and technical communities.

  While MathML was supposed to solve the problem of rendering mathematics on the web it lacks in both implementations and general interest from browser vendors. However, in the past decade, many math rendering tools have been pushing math on the web forward using HTML/CSS and SVG.

  One of the identified issues is that, while browser manufacturers have continually improved and extended their HTML and CSS layout engines, the approaches to render mathematics have not been able to align with these improvements. In fact, the current approaches to math layout could be considered to be largely disjoint from the other technologies of OWP. Another key issue, is that exposing (and thus leveraging) semantic information of mathematical and scientific content on the web needs to move towards modern practices and standards instead of being limited to a single solution (MathML). Such information is critical for accessibility, machine-readability, and re-use of mathematical content.

  This Community Group intends to look at the problems of math on the web in a very bottom-up manner. Experts in this group should identify how the core OWP layout engines, centered around HTML, SVG, and CSS, can be re-used for the purpose of mathematical layout by mapping mathematical entities on top of these, thereby ensuring a much more efficient result, and making use of current and future OWP optimization possibilities. Similarly, experts should work to identify best practices for semantics from the point of view of today's successful solutions.

  This work should also reveal where the shortcomings are, from the mathematical layout point of view, in the details of these OWP technologies, and propose improvements and possible additions to these, with the ultimate goal of reaching out to the responsible W3C Working Groups to make these changes. This work may also reveal new technology areas that should be specified and standardized on their own right, for example in the area of Web Accessibility.

  The ultimate goal is to pave the way for a standard, highly optimized implementation architecture, on top of which mathematical syntaxes, like LaTeX or MathML, may be mapped to provide an efficient display of mathematical formulae. Note that, although this community group will concentrate on mathematics, many other areas, e.g., science and engineering, will benefit from (and factor into) the approach and from the core architecture.

  This community effort aims to provide medical,healthcare and life-science specialized web schemas and vocabulary through improving and extending the existing schemas, concepts, terms and definitions in schema.org vocabulary. Ultimate goal is to enable the use of schema.org not only by webmasters but also in indexing health records, healthcare documents, and as a pillar open source of medical and healthcare and life science ontology/vocabulary for formalization of healthcare information.

  This will make healthcare and medical data on web easy to describe correctly (with their correct meaning and context), easy to expose /index so ready to be accessible and will highly improve to re-usability and exchanging in semantic way, with their correct meaning and context.

  The intention is not to replace existing ontologies, nor making upper level ontology nor creating yet another clinical information model/standards. The aim is mainly to provide most useful and frequently used (so, demand driven) classes and properties related to the medical and healthcare domain. Within this scope all concepts are mapped as far as it's feasible to the existing terminology like SNOMED CT, ICD, LOINC, ATC, RxNorm, HL7 FHIR, etc.

  Created on 22 October 2014 <span class="participants" data-participants="32">(32 participants)</span>

  Semantic data is available widely and semantic data exploration is becoming a key activity in a range of application domains, such as government organisations, education, life science, cultural heritage, and media. Several novel interfaces and interaction means for exploration of semantic data are being proposed, for example exploratory search systems, semantic data browsers, ontology/content visualisation environments and semantic wikis. Although on the rise, the current solutions are still maturing and need to take into account human factors to make exploration intuitive or employ necessary computational models to aid the intuitiveness and improve the effectiveness of exploration tasks. Lessons also can be learned from the commonalities and differences in exploration requirements between different domains. Hence, greater benefits can be achieved by bringing together expertise from different communities, including HCI, Semantic Web, and personalisation with the potential application domain demands. This group is an effort to bring these community together to benefit from the mutual experiences in solving some new and exciting problems. This group will not publish specifications.

  Sometimes an error reported against an XML document can be fixed automatically, for example if the error refers to an unexpected attribute then an automatic fix will be to delete that unexpected attribute. We want to explore the issues related to applying quick fixes (like preserving DOCTYPE declarations, entities, etc.) and determine what actions will be needed be able to apply quick fixes on a document as well as a representation language to describe these actions. Quick fixes are especially interesting when we use Schematron for XML validation, as in this case the quick-fix should be specified by the schema author, so we have user-defined quick fixes. Imagine for example a business rule implemented in Schematron that says that a list should contain between 4 and 8 items. If we determine that there are two items then a quick fix will propose to add automatically two more items to the list or if the list has 10 items then a quick fix may propose to delete two items or to split the list in two lists, etc.

  The Open Data Directory lists products, services and research projects that leverage Linked Data. Currently, the Directory serves as an aggregator of use cases and web sites using Linked Data and is expected to evolve over time in response user requirements. The Directory is a community service project to foster ease-of-use and awareness of Open Data on the Web. The Directory has an easy to use Web interface enabling users to list: - Organization name - Contact name - Product(s) - Service(s) - Projects & Use Cases The Open Data Directory periodically gathers Linked Data from designated sites and compiles it into a summarized view of the community. It is a purely Linked Data application and not another "walled garden." Organizations are responsible for publishing their own Linked Data for the Directory to consume.

  The mission of the Automotive and Transportation Group is to act as an incubator of ideas for standardization for connected vehicles and the broader transportation data space. It had produced some early draft specifications for making vehicle signals available in a browser runtime as a first class object. Those specifications were the basis for launching the [W3C Automotive Working Group](https://www.w3.org/auto/wg/). The Auto Working Group has since changed to service specifications to expose signals in a broader range of computing environments and bringing this extremely useful telematics information to the cloud.

  Fuller description of current and evolving scope is in [the charter](https://www.w3.org/2020/auto-transportation-charter).

  Created on 15 February 2013 <span class="participants" data-participants="39">(39 participants)</span>

  The Permanent Identifier Community Group maintains a secure, permanent UL re-direction service for the Web located at w3id.org. Web applications that deal with Linked Data often need to specify and use URLs that are very stable. They utilize services such as the one run by this community to ensure that applications using their URLs will always be re-directed to a working website. The concept operates much like a switchboard, connecting requests for information with the true location of the information on the Web. Entries in the switchboard can be reconfigured to point to a new location if the old location stops working. The community is responsible for all administrative tasks associated with operating the service. The social contract between organizations involved in the community gives each of them full access to all information required to maintain and operate the website. The agreement is setup such that a number of these organizations could fail, lose interest, or become unresponsive for long periods of time without negatively affecting the operation of the site. The service operates in HTTPS-only mode to ensure end-to-end security. This means that it may be used for Linked Data applications that require high levels of security such as those found in the financial, medical, and public infrastructure sectors. All identifiers associated with the service are intended to be around for as long as the Web is around. This means decades, if not centuries. If the final destination for popular identifiers used by this service fail in such a way as to be a major inconvenience or danger to the Web, the community will mirror the information for the popular identifier and setup a working redirect to restore service to the rest of the Web. You may join this community by getting a W3C account and clicking the join button. If you wish to engage the community in discussion about this service for your Web application, please send an e-mail to the public-perma-id@w3.org mailing list. This group does not create specifications.

  Data is commonly considered as a new kind of fuel powering economical, cultural and societal changes. From e-governance to smart cities, many examples can be found to argue for the value of open and connected data. By turning the Web into a data publishing platform Linked Data is a key enabling technology for this. It has yet to be kept in mind that as of 2012 65% of the world does not have access to the Web and are thus deprived from Linked Data. Furthermore is this population sorely in need for the changes data-driven societies benefit from. This community group is there to discuss some important questions such as: \* How can development related data be published as Linked Data? \* What kind of data is out there and what is relevant to drive societal changes in underprivileged countries? \* How can those without Web access can consume open data set published as Linked Open Data? \* How can the Linked Data principles be revised to be applicable in Web-less contexts? This group will not publish Specifications.

  Created on 17 April 2012 <span class="participants" data-participants="59">(59 participants)</span>

  Many philosophical issues have arisen in the technical design of Web standards over the years. Philosophical conundrums sometimes seem out of context in the light of seemingly more pressing technical problems. Yet, the very fact that these philosophical problems are constantly raised indicates that they are not easily dispensed with, but should instead be the focus of serious and ongoing long-term discussions. This is why this CG aims at undertaking such discussions, even outsourcing them to alleviate the task of other groups. To clarify the goal of this CG: it should not be a place to do unconstrained philosophical research but rather a forum to examine issues arising from the W3C technical community. Open discussion and precise descriptions of the minutiae of the Web will help guide the work in the CG, which should output short guides on precise topics to help case progress and discussions in other groups. The PhiloWeb Community group aims to undertake such discussions by bringing together experts from the web and the philosophical community to help the task of "philosophical engineering", a term coined by Tim Berners-Lee.

  The purpose of the Open Annotation Community Group is to work towards a common, RDF-based, specification for annotating digital resources. The effort will start by working towards a reconciliation of two proposals that have emerged over the past two years: the Annotation Ontology \[1\] and the Open Annotation Model \[2\]. Initially, editors of these proposals will closely collaborate to devise a common draft specification that addresses requirements and use cases that were identified in the course of their respective efforts. The goal is to make this draft available for public feedback and experimentation in the second quarter of 2012. The final deliverable of the Open Annotation Community Group will be a specification, published under an appropriate open license, that is informed by the existing proposals, the common draft specification, and the community feedback. \[1\] http://code.google.com/p/annotation-ontology/ \[2\] http://www.openannotation.org/spec/beta/

  Created on 12 October 2011 <span class="participants" data-participants="14">(14 participants)</span>

  The recent years have shown the need to deal with networked data in large-scale, distributed settings. Not only must the systems be scalable, elastic and performant, but also address \*ability (usability, manageability, etc.). One key component is doing it the webby way. The Web is the leading concrete exemplar of RESTful design, being the result of posthumous analysis of what was already working with URIs, HTTP and HTML for a system of interlinked documents. Unfortunately the machine equivalent of HTML is still emerging. LinkedData has achieved some powerful results; automated navigation by querying the Linked Open Data cloud shows some of the potential. However many systems also need to evolve and be evolved. This can be expressed as 'service capability' and also needs to be supported with consistency. This should aim to eliminate the wide range of non-interoperable approaches muddling the current landscape of REST APIs through exploiting hypermedia concepts. The Networked Data Community Group aims to provide a forum for collecting use cases including but not limited to the fields of science data (such as biology, astronomy, etc.), economics data (financial markets, etc.), health care, configuration and systems management, Green IT, and smart infrastructures (cities, etc.). Based on the collection of use cases the CG will derive requirements and write up best practices for dealing with the dynamics of the data.

It will focus on a common representation for abstract ideas in the news domain such as a 'news event' or a domain ontology for news. This includes the following subject areas: 1. Review, test and comment on existing and proposed standards for semantic technologies in the news domain. 2. Encourage the reuse of well-known datasets and ontologies and propose mappings between them as required. 3. Best practices for publishing, exchanging and linking data, including use cases. 4. Development of prototypes to help build the business case for this approach. 5. Discuss design principles of schemas and ontologies.

  The Web-Native Community Group is a focused initiative to bring the current developer community overrun by frameworks back to native web technologies, so that everyone can bank more on the platform and less on abstractions. This is a targeted intervention to the now sweeping "framework-first" thinking for a new "native-first" thinking among developers. Whatever were the reasons for the former at the time, it no longer aligns with the current state of the platform and its fast-evolving future. It is now, more so than ever, a compelling problem to fix, and this community group will do just that! We hope to build on the work of existing posts in the community, that are, at least, looking for a paradigm shift. More importantly, our key activity will be working with the developer community and other W3C community groups to: (1) implement strategies that engage the developer community to put native languages, APIs, and methodologies at the heart of their everyday work, and (2) facilitate proposals that can bring various common development paradigms to native implementation, or to say the least, provide low-level primitives to support higher-level implementations of these paradigms that represents the modern web.

By knowledge domain we mean such human disciplines as mathematics, physics, chemistry and other STEM disciplines. We also include disciplines such as music, economics, history and linguistics. We are particularly interested in disciplines that convey knowledge using discipline specific symbology which cannot currently gain effective communication through HTML. We further include domain specific markup systems as well as graphical representation such as SVG rendering.

  This group may publish Specifications.

  Created on 8 October 2013 <span class="participants" data-participants="11">(11 participants)</span>

  Irrespective of whether we like it or not, of whether W3C or other SDOs eventually accept it or not, DRM seems slated to come to the Web platform. We are looking at video today, but books, apps, and therefore relatively arbitrary Web documents could easily be next. The business pressure to do so is such that there is little in the way that technology can do to stop this process. Our communities may produce everything from learned recantations to bitter rants, words will not suffice to address the problem. The only way in which we can decisively put a stop to DRM is by changing the legal system which can make it seem desirable to some. The goal of this group is to produce a set of realistic proposals for Web-compatible copyright legislation. Its focus is very much pragmatic, the idea being not to produce an idealistic laundry list for some free content utopia, but rather actionable proposals that stand a chance of passing into law. This group will not produce specifications.

  The mission of the Merchant Community Group (“Merchant CG”) is to improve the Web for people and organisations that sell goods or services, or accept donations online. This includes both business-to-business (B2B) merchants, business-to-consumer (B2C) merchants as well as not-for-profit donation acceptors. In this non-technical forum, participants will discuss merchant challenges, how emerging Web technologies could help address them, and what additional Web capabilities may be necessary. Likely topics include:

  - Customer interaction, capture and retention via accessible immersive Web experiences;
  - Web checkout experiences, including the value merchants should gain with W3C's Web payments standards;
  - Emerging regulatory requirements (e.g., related to privacy or accessibility) and ensuring good customer experience;
  - The evolution of Web advertising;
  - Good practices for reducing online fraud;
  - Enhancements to transaction integrity and assurance;
  - Improving mobile Web commerce experiences.

  ### Scope

  Participants will choose and prioritize discussion topics.

  **Activities in Scope**

  - Education about Web technology trends and the impact on merchants, including through discussions with other W3C groups. These activities will include non-technical briefings.
  - Identification of current merchant challenges, best practices for addressing them, and how those practices may change for various reasons (e.g., due to evolving privacy practices).
  - Communication of merchant use cases and requirements to groups within and outside W3C.
  - Coordinating reviews of the work of other W3C groups (e.g., the Web Payments Working Group, Web Authentication Working Group or Immersive Web Working Group). It is a goal that this group enable high-bandwidth, two-way communication channels with other W3C groups.

  **Activities out of Scope**

  - Development of technical specifications.
  - Discussion of specific products or implementations consistent with W3C's Antitrust and Competition Guidance.

- ## <a href="/community/graphql-rdf/" id="graphql-rdf">Bridging GraphQL and RDF</a>

  Created on 31 January 2020 <span class="participants" data-participants="53">(53 participants)</span>

  The aim of this group is to explore how GraphQL and RDF can be combined, and to what respect they can benefit each other. This group explores possible combinations of GraphQL and RDF. We identify and compare existing approaches that bridge these worlds, collect use cases and requirements for such approaches, and characterize corresponding application areas. This will produce deliverables that may serve as input for one or more possible future standardization efforts. Examples of application areas combining GraphQL and RDF are:

  - Read/Write Access (CRUD) to and from RDF data via GraphQL queries and/or interfaces
  - Validation of RDF graphs using GraphQL schemas
  - Mapping between GraphQL and RDF-based shape languages

  This group aims to produce the following deliverables:

  - An overview of all known approaches that combine GraphQL and RDF. This overview will include a brief description of each approach, the company/organization that has developed it, and links to the corresponding documentation.
  - An analysis of all known approaches that combine GraphQL and RDF. This analysis will include a categorization across one or more facets that will be identified.
  - A final report on suggestions/possibilities for standardization.

  MathML first became a W3C recommendation in 1998. It has wide support in the publishing industry and with assistive technology. MathML has had several updates, but is showing its age and needs to be updated. This group will focus on changes to the MathML 3 recommendation so that it better aligns with the current web environment, eases the burden on browser implementations, and increases support for assistive technology. The group will propose a new revision for MathML, potentially with profiles for browsers, publishers, and other subgroups such as authors or online tests. The group will also develop tests so that authors/publishers can be confident that what they see as an author is what the user will see as a reader when the same font is used. Participation is encouraged if you are in involved in publishing, authoring, or rendering math. The group strongly encourages the participation of those involved with browser implementations, recommendations, and APIs that potentially affect the rendering of math.

  This group discusses semantic ontologies for the Big Data space. It is supported initially by the H2020 Big Data Europe project. The mission of this group is to cooperate, discuss and agree on semantic vocabularies to support applications in the domain of big data processing. It is a conscious choice to initiate one forum to discuss and agree on various new vocabularies and/or their amendments. With this one group we hope to reach a broader public. The different ontologies have a common aim: describe tools such that they can be reused in semantic empowered applications for big data processing. At launch this will include ontologies for the Docker ecosystem and for Har-files. The former is used for setting up stacks in the Big Data Europe project, the latter for analysing HTTP requests.

  Created on 17 July 2015 <span class="participants" data-participants="27">(27 participants)</span>

  Currently Experience API (xAPI) mostly focuses on providing “structural” interoperability via JavaScript Object Notation Language (JSON). Structural interoperability defines the syntax of the data exchange and ensures the data exchanged between systems can be interpreted at the data field level. In comparison, semantic interoperability leverages the structural interoperability of the data exchange, but provides a vocabulary so other systems and consumers can also interpret the data. Analytics produced by xAPI statements would benefit from more consistent and semantic approaches to describing domain-specific verbs. The xAPI specification recommends implementers to adopt community-defined vocabularies, but the only current guidance is to provide very basic, human-readable identifier metadata (e.g., literal string name(display), description). The main objective of the Vocabulary and Semantic Interoperability Working Group (WG) is to research machine-readable, semantic technologies (e.g., RDF, JSON-LD) in order to produce guidance for Communities of Practice (CoPs) on creating, publishing, or managing controlled vocabulary datasets (e.g., verbs).

  This group brings together experts in the area of building information modelling (BIM) and Web of Data technologies to define existing and future use cases and requirements for linked data based applications across the life cycle of buildings. A list of recommended use cases will be produced by this community group. The envisioned target beneficiaries of this group are both industrial and governmental organisations who use data from building information modelling applications and other data related to the building life cycle (sensor data, GIS data, material data, geographical data, and so forth) to achieve their business processes and whom will benefit from greater integration of data and interoperability between their data sets and the wider linked data communities. For example, benefit may be obtained by publishing and combining localised data on new cheaper building materials, energy efficient building devices and systems, along with real time data on weather patterns, energy prices and geodata. By making this data available to applications, they will be better able to support decision makers during the whole of the building life cycle, which includes design, construction, commissioning, operation, retrofitting/refurbishment/reconfiguration, demolition, and recycling of buildings. The group will engage with these beneficiaries through surveys and events organised in conjunction with the affiliated workshop series on Linked Data for Architecture and Construction (LDAC).

  Created on 26 September 2011 <span class="participants" data-participants="90">(90 participants)</span>

  The goal of the Games Community Group is to improve the quality of open web standards that games developers rely on to create games. To achieve its goal, the Games community group will:

  - Track specifications and vendor implementations related to open web games.
  - Recommend new specifications to be produced and find group homes for them.
  - Refine use cases to communicate specific needs of games.
  - Suggest refinements or fixes to existing specifications to better meet the needs of the game development community.
  - Explore capabilities —APIs, semantics, techniques for rendering, processing, personalization, customization, interoperability, etc.— that developers can leverage to localize games and guarantee that they are accessible.
  - Evangelize specifications to browser vendors.
  - Document how to best use open web standards for games.
  - Evangelize open web standards to game developers and game development best practices to web developers.

  The Games community group will not develop any normative specification. As such, there will not be any Essential Claims under the W3C [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/) or [Final Specification Agreement](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/final/).

  Please see the [adopted charter](https://www.w3.org/2020/07/games-cg-charter.html) for details.

  Created on 10 June 2021 <span class="participants" data-participants="29">(29 participants)</span>

  Improving the accessibility features of browsers, other user agents, and operating systems makes every app and web site they render more accessible to people with disabilities. The Accessibility Features Community Group (AFCG) promotes the development of these accessibility features.

  People with disabilities will find similar features across browsers and operating systems that also work consistently for all provided content. For content creators, reliable built-in features will help to focus their accessibility efforts on addressing challenges unique to their content. These accessibility features can come in a variety of forms, such as:

  - Always-on features, such as page and app resizing
  - Toggles, such as always-visible focus indicators and high contrast modes
  - Settings, like preferred fonts and smallest text size
  - Fallback features, like automated captions and heading detection

  To promote the development of new accessibility features, AFCG will develop a list of recommended accessibility features. This list will include accessibility features already available, but also ideas for new accessibility features that can be shown to work through prototypes. To encourage the implementation of recommended accessibility features, AFCG will track which of these are supported in common browsers and operating systems.

  The Accessibility Features Community Group will not develop any normative specification. As such, there will not be any Essential Claims under the W3C [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/) or [Final Specification Agreement](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/final/).

  The mission of the Semantic Web Health Care and Life Sciences Community Group (HCLS CG) is to develop, advocate for, and support the use of Semantic Web technologies across health care, life sciences, clinical research and translational medicine. These domains stand to gain tremendous benefit from intra- and inter-domain application of Semantic Web technologies as they depend on the interoperability of information from many disciplines. The HCLS CG provides a forum for supporting, developing and applying Semantic Web technologies across healthcare, life sciences, clinical research and the continuum of translational medicine. Within these contexts, the HCLS CG focuses on the use of Semantic Web technologies to realize specific use cases which themselves have a specific clinical, research of business values. As use cases are developed, HCLS CG can solicit advice on technical matters from other Semantic Web related groups and give feedback on the use of technologies based on the work they do. The CG may also develop ongoing and mutually productive liaisons with relevant external organizations in healthcare, life sciences, and clinical research, including organizations that are actively working on relevant standards and/or implementations to which the HCLS’s work might contribute.

  A web based blockchain project to explore the use of Digital Names within existing web applications and PaaS and IaaS platforms. The English or human language naming solution presented by Digital Names solves a big problem related to the scale-up of blockchain networks and cryptocurrency systems. Over a hundred million consumers in the globally currently use eWallets. There are over 100 million Crypto trading accounts registered on the worlds crypto exchanges. All currently use Public Crypto Keys for transaction settlement. New companies and individuals entering the emerging blockchain / crypto financial system for the first time frequently find it difficult to understand how to easily send and receive money from eWallets. To regular people or mainstream users the precise steps involved with sending and receiving digital money is currently limiting usage of the blockchain. It is confusing and intimidating, and creates insecurity of inputting keys wrong and losing the value of a transaction. Digital Names simplifies the remembering, typing and everyday usage of digital wallets for crypto and kind of crypto payments or receipts into or out of a Digital Wallet.

  ### Goals

  The goals of the Community Group on Human Service Data are to:

  1.  Create an ongoing conversation space around world data standards in the human service sector, involving stakeholders from multiple perspectives including:
      1.  government human service agencies, for-profit companies, and NGOs;
      2.  diverse substantive areas, such as welfare benefits eligibility, health interfaces, information and referral services, homelessness, substance abuse, child welfare, aging and disability resources, juvenile justice, etc.;
      3.  diverse stakeholder purposes including exchange of data for operational purposes and collection of data for performance measurement, evaluation and policy research.
  2.  Facilitate the development, improvement and convergence of human service data standards, vocabularies, ontologies, and domain models by:
      1.  Cataloging human services ontologies worldwide, and creating a Linked Open Data directory of the ontologies. The directory should contain metadata, such as audience, jurisdiction, potential ontology improvements, related ontologies, and other notes. See Github site linked off the group page for group artifacts.
      2.  Fostering wider recognition of existing efforts and artifacts
      3.  Analyzing the strengths, limitations, and areas of overlap, agreement and divergence of existing efforts and artifacts
      4.  Identifying areas where standards do not yet exist, but are needed
      5.  Convening working groups of diverse composition to develop and improve standards
  3.  Promote the adoption of human services standards

  ### Scope of Work

  The boundary of the Community Group’s work is the set of substantive areas which are recognized in the United States and/or internationally as falling within the human service sector. This includes but is not limited to information and referral services, income support and other welfare benefits, employment training, homelessness, substance abuse, mental health, child welfare, juvenile justice, domestic violence, and senior services.

  The borders between the human service sector on the one hand and the health, education and justice sectors on the other hand are not firmly defined. The community group will be open to working on any area that is related to the human services and is not entirely within the boundaries of the health, education or justice sectors.

  ### Deliverables

  To be determined.

  Developers and designers form an important audience for W3C standards, but the standards process itself is not an ideal way to engage with them. W3C has made strides in terms of developer relations in recent years, through W3Conf, Web Education XG and CG, easy access to W3C through community groups, more documentation, and online training. More can be done to reach more people and better reflect their interests in W3C. Initial ideas: \* Create a developer relations activity or domain, to coordinate and explore different ways to directly engage with developers and designers, to gain early feedback on our specifications. \* Make W3C a home for more useful documentation, demos, etc. \* Support developer advocacy, in which ideas, use cases, and requirements for features or specification fixes are collected in detail from developers and designers, and presented to the appropriate W3C Groups. \* Liaise with Members' developer relations departments on projects of mutual benefit. This group will not publish Specifications.

  JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linking Data) is a lightweight Linked Data format that gives your data context. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on the already successful JSON format and provides a way to help JSON data interoperate at Web-scale. If you are already familiar with JSON, writing JSON-LD is very easy.

- ## <a href="/community/consent/" id="consent">Consent</a>

  Created on 12 November 2020 <span class="participants" data-participants="40">(40 participants)</span>

  The concept of consent plays an essential role in the use of digital technologies as an enabler of the individual’s ownership, control, and agency. Regulations such as the GDPR assert this relationship by permitting use of consent as one of the possible legal bases for the lawful practice of data processing. Through this, obtaining consent is widely practised in the digital world, and can be perceived as an essential means to enable the individual’s agency regarding the management and ownership of their personal data. While different legal frameworks specify various requirements and obligations regarding the legal validity of consent, which should be, e.g. valid, freely given, specific, informed and active; existing and ongoing research shows that the majority of people are not empowered to practice their digital right to privacy and lawful "consenting" due to various malpractices and a lack of technological means acting in the individuals' interest. This group aims to contribute towards the empowerment of humans concerning their rights of privacy and agency, by advocating interdisciplinary, pluralist, human-centric approaches to digital consent that are technologically and legally enforceable. The mission of this group is to improve the experience of digital "consenting" while ensuring it remains adherent to relevant standards and laws. For this, the group will: (i) provide a space for people and stakeholders to come together (ii) highlight and analyse concepts, issues and problems about digital consenting (iii) propose and develop solutions. Some concrete areas for the working of this group are: (a) developing interdisciplinary solutions; (b) documenting and achieving legal compliance; (c) improving the user experience; and (d) utilising existing and developing new concepts and standards for digital consent.

  Created on 14 June 2021 <span class="participants" data-participants="15">(15 participants)</span>

  A problem with terms of service agreements is that they often require an all-or-none acceptance or rejection. In addition, they may be in a form that is not accessible to persons with disabilities making it difficult to make an informed decision. The mission of this community group is to find ways that help users understand what they are being asked to commit to, and to provide a finer grain of control in terms of what they are willing to share. The overall goal is to put control of personal data into an individual’s hands. The group's primary activity is to discuss and report on how to make terms of service agreements comprehensible to users and to provide a means by which users can express their preferences regarding their personal data. The reports may include descriptions of use cases, user interface wire frames, plain language proposals, and supports that educate users about personal data and data sharing. The group will define a way for users to express preferences regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of their personal information. These preferences will be "portable" in the sense that they are encoded once and can be used on a variety of platforms including websites, desktops, and mobile devices, among others. People interested in educating users regarding personal data and data sharing, inclusive user interface design, and the use of plain language in policies and service agreements are welcome. This group may publish specifications. Charter (WIP): https://inclusive-design.github.io/cg-portable-personal-data-preferences/CGCharter.html

  Building Web APIs seems still more an art than a science. How can we build APIs such that generic clients can easily use them? And how do we build those clients? Current APIs heavily rely on out-of-band information such as human-readable documentation and API-specific SDKs. However, this only allows for very simple and brittle clients that are hardcoded against specific APIs. Hydra, in contrast, is a set of technologies that allow to design APIs in a different manner, in a way that enables smarter clients. The foundation is laid by the Hydra Core Vocabulary. It defines a number of fundamental concepts, such as hypermedia controls and collections, which allow machines to understand how to interact with an API. Since all information about the API is available in a machine-readable form, completely generic clients become possible. The Core Vocabulary is complemented by Linked Data Fragments, a set of specifications that enable advanced yet efficient client-side querying of Web APIs. More information about these technologies can be found on our homepage: http://www.hydra-cg.com/

  This group serves to promote and expand ShEx – Shape Expressions. ShEx is an alternative to SHACL which uses a syntactic representation to describe the shape of an RDF graph. The Shape Expressions (ShEx) language describes RDF nodes and graph structures. A node constraint describes an RDF node (IRI, blank node or literal) and a shape describes the triples touching nodes in RDF graphs. These descriptions identify predicates and their associated cardinalities and datatypes. ShEx shapes can be used to communicate data structures associated with some process or interface, generate or validate data, or drive user interfaces. Spec at https://shexspec.github.io/spec/

  The aim of the Rights Automation for Market Data Community Group is to develop and publish a market-data profile for ODRL.

  Market data is mostly the pricing and trading data for financial instruments (and their associated indices) generated by trading venues. The licenses controlling its use are frequently complex, and tightly segment the underlying data.

  We will model these licenses using ODRL and extend the language with a profile that defines the new terms required. This group will publish Specifications.

  With a standard, machine-readable way of describing market data licenses, we can look towards automating rights-management along the market data supply chain and drive efficiencies in financial markets.

  The group welcomes the involvement of domain experts in licensing (especially market data) and those skilled in modeling licenses (especially using ODRL).

  Matching entities across data sources using different identifiers and formats is a pervasive issue on the web. This group revolves around developing a web API that data providers can expose, which eases the reconciliation of third-party data to their own identifiers. OpenRefine's reconciliation API is used as a starting point. Our goals are to document this existing API, share our experiences and lessons learnt from it, propose an improved protocol in the view of promoting it as a standard, and build tooling around it.

Desirable outcomes include the development of educational material (primers, best practices), the application of SHACL to frequently used RDF vocabularies, libraries of constraint components for common constraint types, improved integration with established technologies such as JavaScript, further work on theory and practice around SHACL rules, a compact SHACL syntax, and a SHACL internet protocol. Additional work may go into delivering "de-facto standard" fixes to some gaps left in the current SHACL specifications (e.g., handling recursion, and addressing more comprehensive syntax checks).

  Created on 12 April 2021 <span class="participants" data-participants="58">(58 participants)</span>

  The Spec Editors Community Group aims to be an inclusive space where spec editors, and those wanting to become spec editors, can learn from each other.

  The Spec Ed CG focuses on the practice (the art?) of writing technical specifications across the Web ecosystem (W3C, WHATWG, ECMA, IETF, etc.). By looking across the ecosystem, we hope to improve our specification development practices at the W3C.

  As part of this CG, we hope to run hands-on virtual tutorial sessions that will cover:

  - spec writing: writing algorithms, types of statements.
  - tooling: ReSpec and Bikeshed.
  - testing: Web Platform Tests.
  - How review specs: what to look for, commenting on pull requests.
  - leveraging fundamental technologies: WebIDL, Infra standard, HTML, etc.
  - Using GitHub effectively for spec development: labels, milestones, managing your community.
  - More things! Let us know...

  Created on 4 April 2019 <span class="participants" data-participants="88">(88 participants)</span>

  The ACT Rules Community Group (previously known as Auto-WCAG), is an open forum set up to document and harmonise the interpretation of W3C accessibility standards, such as WCAG and WAI-ARIA, for testing purposes. The ACT Rules Community Group (ACT-R) achieves this by bringing together the people developing, implementing and using various accessibility testing tools and methodologies to document interpretations as test rules. Test rules are defined using the ACT Rules Format, and reviewed by the community. The process of researching, documenting, and sharing knowledge from different perspectives within the group, builds towards a common understanding. Publishing rules is not an end point for harmonization, it's a starting point. By publishing such test rules, ACT-R hopes to motivate organisations to share their own insights, and encourage adoption of commonly agreed test rules. ACT-R is not set up to remove differences or impose changes on accessibility testing tools and methodologies. There is value in innovation and diverse approaches. Rather it aims to contribute to more consistent results, regardless of how the testing is done. Knowing when something meets a requirement, and when it does not, should be clear and consistent. This group will not publish specifications.

  Created on 16 March 2021 <span class="participants" data-participants="18">(18 participants)</span>

  We choose which representations of our data to use, JSON, CSV, XML, or whatever, depending on habit, convenience, or the context we want to use that data in. On the other hand, having an interoperable generic toolchain such as that provided by XML to process data is of immense value. How do we resolve the conflicting requirements of convenience, habit, and context, and still enable a generic toolchain? Invisible XML (ixml) is a method for treating non-XML documents as if they were XML, enabling authors to write documents and data in a format they prefer while providing XML for processes that are more effective with XML content. This is an ongoing project to provide software that lets you treat any parsable format as if it were XML, without the need for markup.

  Created on 10 December 2019 <span class="participants" data-participants="32">(32 participants)</span>

  The real world is frustratingly uncertain, incomplete and inconsistent. This is challenging for traditional approaches to information systems, and a new paradigm is needed that combines symbolic and statistical techniques, building upon decades of work in the cognitive sciences, and over 500 million years of natural selection. This will allow us to create cognitive agents that learn and reason based upon prior knowledge and past experience, and which can satisfy the need for, transparency in decision making, and continuous learning for adapting to ever changing needs. This community group will address opportunities for cognitive agents using graphs, statistics, rules and graph algorithms, starting with an amalgam of RDF and Property Graphs, together with Web architecture for cognitive databases.

  More specifically, the Cognitive AI Community Group will work on use cases and requirements, demo's, open source, and scaling experiments. For more details, see:

  Created on 7 June 2016 <span class="participants" data-participants="39">(39 participants)</span>

  Existing W3C voice interaction standards such as VoiceXML are based on use cases centered around telephony-based voice systems. The typical interaction style that these standards support is system-initiated directed dialog using grammars to constrain the speech recognizer. In recent years, interaction with voice applications has become much more flexible, with a user-initiated dialog style and significantly fewer constraints on spoken input. Many of these new applications take the form of "virtual assistants". These include general-purpose assistants (for example, Siri, Cortana, Google Now and Alexa) as well as virtual assistants with specialized domain expertise. The proposed Community Group will collect new use cases for voice interaction, develop requirements for applications such as virtual assistants and explore areas for possible standardization, possibly producing specifications if appropriate. Depending on interest, this exploration could include such topics as (1) discovery of virtual assistants with specific expertise, for example a way to find a virtual assistant that can supply weather information (2) standard formats for statistical language models for speech recognizers (3) standard representations for references to common concepts such as time (4) interoperability for conversational interfaces and (5) work on dialogue management or ‘workflow' languages . New functionality for existing voice standards can also be a topic of discussion. Speech application developers and voice user interface designers should be particularly interested in this group.

  Created on 24 May 2018 <span class="participants" data-participants="74">(74 participants)</span>

  The mission of the W3C Data Privacy Vocabularies and Controls CG (DPVCG) is to develop a taxonomy of privacy and data protection related terms, which include in particular terms from the new European [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj), such as a taxonomy of personal data as well as a classification of purposes (i.e., purposes for data collection), and events of disclosures, consent, and processing such personal data.

  The DPVCG was created as an outcome of the W3C Workshop on Data Privacy Controls and Vocabularies in Vienna in 2017, and started on 25th May 2018 – the date of the enforcement of GDPR. Since then, the DPVCG has worked to fulfil its aims and objectives, and produced the [Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV)](https://www.w3.org/ns/dpv) as a deliverable.

  Membership to the group is open to all interested individuals and organisations. To join the group, you need a valid W3C account – which is free to get and can be [requested here](https://www.w3.org/accounts/request). The group meets usually through online meeting calls, details of which, including past minutes, can be [found here](https://www.w3.org/community/dpvcg/wiki/Meeting_Calls). The group also interacts through a [mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/) regarding topics, discussions, sharing of agendas, actions, and other relevant items. The resources and work relevant to the group is hosted on the [GitHub platform under the DPVCG name](https://github.com/dpvcg/).

  The group is currently chaired by:

  - [Harshvardhan J. Pandit](https://harshp.com) ([ADAPT SFI Research Centre](https://www.adaptcentre.ie/), [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/))
  - [Bert Bos](https://www.w3.org/People/Bos/) ([ERCIM](https://www.ercim.eu/) [W3C](https://www.w3.org))
  - [Axel Polleres](http://polleres.net/) [(WU Wirschaftsuniversitat Wien – Vienna University of Economics and Business](https://www.wu.ac.at/))

  ## Participation in Group Activities

  The working of the group is fairly open and transparent in its process, with most of the information present on the [wiki](https://www.w3.org/community/dpvcg/wiki/). For past work, actions, issues, and records – please refer to the [wiki](https://www.w3.org/community/dpvcg/wiki/) and threads on the [mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/). Anyone can use the [mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/) to ask questions, suggest topics, raise issues, and offer solutions. Non-members might receive an automated reply asking them to authenticate their email or email address for posting.

  Similarly, calls are usually open to attend, with the agenda shared on the public mailing list. Call details may be shared on the internal mailing lists accessible to only members for security purposes – so it may be best to ask the chair(s) or a member for attending a call.

  General questions regarding what the group considers in scope can be determined from the aims and objectives. Specific queries or propositions should be conveyed to the mailing list. For issues regarding the DPV, including addition of concepts or a query or other relevant topics – you can use the mailing list or the issues feature in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dpvcg/).

  ## Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV)

  The DPV is a vocabulary (terms) and an ontology (relationships) serialised using semantic-web standards to represent concepts associated with privacy and data protection, primarily derived from GDPR. It enables representation of which _personal data categories_ are undergoing a what kind of _processing_ by a specific _data controller_ and/or transferred to some _recipient_ for a particular _purpose_, based on a specific _legal basis_ (e.g., consent, or other legal grounds such as legitimate interest, etc.), with specified _technical and organisational measures and restrictions_ (e.g., storage locations and storage durations) in place.

  The DPV is useful as a machine-readable representation of personal data processing and can be adopted in relevant use-cases such as legal compliance documentation and evaluation, policy specification, consent representation and requests, taxonomy of legal terms, and annotation of text and data.

  The DPV is an evolving vocabulary – as the DPVCG continues to work on updating it with broader concepts as well as enriching its hierarchy of concepts. For this, we invite contributions of concepts, use-cases, requirements, and applications.

  The mission of the Ontology-Lexicon community group is to: (1) Develop models for the representation of lexica (and machine readable dictionaries) relative to ontologies. These lexicon models are intended to represent lexical entries containing information about how ontology elements (classes, properties, individuals etc.) are realized in multiple languages. In addition, the lexical entries contain appropriate linguistic (syntactic, morphological, semantic and pragmatic) information that constrains the usage of the entry. (2) Demonstrate the added value of representing lexica on the Semantic Web, in particularly focusing on how the use of linked data principles can allow for the re-use of existing linguistic information from resource such as WordNet. (3) Provide best practices for the use of linguistic data categories in combination with lexica. (4) Demonstrate that the creation of such lexica in combination with the semantics contained in ontologies can improve the performance of NLP tools. (5) Bring together people working on standards for representing linguistic information (syntactic, morphological, semantic and pragmatic) building on existing initiatives, and identifying collaboration tracks for the future. (6) Cater for interoperability among existing models to represent and structure linguistic information. (7) Demonstrate the added value of applications relying on the use of the combination of lexica and ontologies.

  Created on 8 April 2013 <span class="participants" data-participants="71">(71 participants)</span>

  Research investigations are increasingly collaborative and require ‘‘borrowing strength’’ from the outputs of other research. Conventional digital publications are becoming less sufficient for the scientists to access, share, communicate, and enable the reuse of scientific outputs. The need to have a community-wide container data model to encapsulate the actual research data and methods with all the contextual information essential for interpreting and reusing them is becoming more and more imperative, for the science, publisher, as well as digital library communities. A number of different community groups and projects are now creating some form of container, bundling or aggregation mechanism (particularly using ORE OAI), partially driven by the above goal. There is a clear need and benefit to facilitate a consensus among these representations. In the ROSC community group we aim to provide an open platform for gathering and discussing current development of various container models and their implementations. These data models should be driven by the need of facilitating the reuse and exchange of the actual digital knowledge and the inspection of the reproducibility of scientific investigation results. They should consider not only the data used, methods employed to produce and analyse that data, but also the people involved in the investigation and annotations about these resources, which are essential to the understanding and interpretation of the scientific outcomes. As outcomes from the community group we aim to facilitate the establishment of a community data model and a set of community agreements that can effectively assist the establishment of a new form of scholarly communication, that is a prominent issue of today. This group will not publish specifications.

  The purpose of the Federated Identity Community Group is to provide a forum focused on incubating web features that will both support federated identity and prevent untransparent, uncontrollable tracking of users across the web. While the community group will take privacy concerns into consideration, these concerns will be balanced against the need to explore innovative ideas around federated authentication on the web.

  The Web NFC Community Group will create a Near Field Communication API that is browser-friendly and adheres to the Web's security model. We believe that means the API will not expose full, low level NFC functionality, but rather a higher level subset that is safe for Web pages, protects user privacy, and does not annoy users with unnecessary or complex permission requests.

  The aims of the [Solid project](https://solidproject.org/) are in line with those of the Web itself: empowerment towards an equitable, informed and interconnected society. Solid adds to existing Web standards to realise a space where individuals can maintain their autonomy, control their data and privacy, and choose applications and services to fulfil their needs.

  The mission of the Solid Community Group is to describe how Solid servers and clients can be interoperable by using Web communication protocols, global identifiers, authentication and authorization mechanisms, data formats and shapes, and query interfaces.

  To contribute towards a net positive social benefit, we use the [Ethical Web Principles](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/) to orient ourselves. The consensus on the technical designs are informed by common use cases, implementation experience, and use.

  [Solid Technical Reports](https://solidproject.org/TR/) lists Work Items, information on how to Participate, and the Solid of Code of Conduct (in addition to the [Positive Work Environment at W3C: Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).)

  Created on 31 July 2014 <span class="participants" data-participants="102">(102 participants)</span>

  Bluetooth is a standard for short-range wireless communication between devices. This group is developing a [specification for Bluetooth APIs](https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/) to allow websites to communicate with devices in a secure and privacy-preserving way. In particular the web Bluetooth API focuses on minimizing the device attack surface exposed to malicious websites, possibly by removing access to some existing Bluetooth features that are hard to implement securely. Further, the API takes the approach of a user interface to select and approve access to devices as opposed to using certification and installation.

  Most of our activity happens in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth), with supporting code in adjacent repositories in the [WebBluetoothCG GitHub organization](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG).

  This community group is part of [the OpenActive initiative](https://www.openactive.io/). Our goal is to develop technical specifications and best practices that will support the use of open and shared data relating to sports and physical activities.

  Our primary focus is on standardising how to publish data about opportunities to be physically activity, defining best practices and APIs to enable booking of events and facilities, and improving interoperability of data across the sector.

  To ensure that our specifications will support a variety of use cases, we welcome contributions from a range of organisations, including existing platforms and new startups.

  While our work is technical, you don’t have to be a developer to contribute to our standards group. We are looking for input from product and service managers whose domain knowledge can help us to create better outputs.

  Created on 28 October 2017 <span class="participants" data-participants="95">(95 participants)</span>

  The mission of the W3C Credible Web Community Group is to help shift the Web toward more trustworthy content without increasing censorship or social division. We want users to be able to tell when content is reliable, accurate, and shared in good faith, and to help them steer away from deceptive content. At the same time, we affirm the need for users to find the content they want and to interact freely in the communities they choose. To balance any conflict between these goals, we are committed to providing technologies which keep end-users in control of their Web experience.

  The group's primary strategy involves data sharing on the Web, in the style of schema.org, using existing W3C data standards like JSON-LD. We believe significant progress toward our goals can be reached by properly specifying "credibility indicators", a vocabulary/schema for data about content and the surrounding ecosystem, which can help a person and/or machine decide whether a content item should be trusted.

  Please see the [group wiki](wiki/) for more details.

  How WAI-ARIA is supported by assistive technologies, such as screen readers, is highly variable. This variation in WAI-ARIA rendering adds unnecessary complexity to the development of high-quality web experiences for users of assistive technologies and places significant limitations on the types of web widgets that can be made widely accessible. This community group is dedicated to: 1. helping assistive technology developers converge on a set of clear norms for baseline support of WAI-ARIA. 2. Helping web developers understand the current state of support for WAI-ARIA by assistive technologies. WAI-ARIA is as important to assistive technology presentation as CSS is to visual presentation.

  The mission of the GPU on the Web Community Group is to provide an interface between the Web Platform and modern 3D graphics and computation capabilities present in native system platforms. The goal is to design a new Web API that exposes these modern technologies in a performant, powerful and safe manner. It should work with existing platform APIs such as Direct3D 12 from Microsoft, Metal from Apple, and Vulkan from the Khronos Group. This API will also expose the generic computational facilities available in today's GPUs to the Web, and investigate shader languages to produce a cross-platform solution. Please see the [draft charter](https://gpuweb.github.io/admin/cg-charter.html). The group is inviting browser engine developers, GPU hardware vendors, 3D software engineers, as well as the broader Web community who have an interest in 3D graphics and efficient computation to participate.
