<span id="intro">Introduction</span>
------------------------------------

**WAI-AGE Project ended as of 30 September 2010.** Up-to-date resources on web accessibility for older people are available at **<http://www.w3.org/WAI/older-users/>**.

<span id="objectives">Objectives</span>
---------------------------------------

The objective of the Web Accessibility and Ageing Task Force (WAI-AGE TF) was to advise WAI-AGE staff and EOWG on development and revision of educational materials and outreach strategies around the requirements of people with accessibility needs related to ageing, in association with the work of the [WAI-AGE Project](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WAI-AGE/). This included:

-   advising on resource collection and analysis (to develop a better understanding of the requirements of people with accessibility needs related to ageing)
-   helping to develop networks and establish a dialog with:
    -   people in the ageing community who are interested in Web accessibility; and
    -   researchers and experts in the field of accessibility and ageing
-   advising on the development of education and outreach materials on relevant Web accessibility resources for Web developers and end-users
-   advising on the revision of existing WAI educational resources, and the development of new resources

WAI-AGE TF operated under the [Charter of the Education and Outreach Working Group](http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/charter4) (EOWG).

<span id="scope">Scope of Work</span>
-------------------------------------

WAI-AGE TF focused on the areas below throughout the duration of the WAI-AGE Project:

### Collection and Understanding of Accessibility Requirements Due to Ageing

Inform and advise on the collection of relevant resources documenting accessibility needs related to ageing for the design of websites, browsers, and authoring tools. Provide advice on the analysis of these resources, and the preparation of a literature review and/or white paper for publishing (possibly as a Working Group Note). Provide input on the effective communication of these findings to developers and end-users.

### Outreach & Networking

Advise the development of strategies and resources to expand networks and promote outreach to people with accessibility needs related to ageing, and to researchers and experts in the field of accessibility and ageing. Also, encourage their participation in WAI groups, and advise WAI on how to support their participation and develop a better mutual understanding between the needs of people with disabilities and those with Web accessibility needs due to ageing.

### Materials Development

WAI-AGE TF participants provided feedback and contribution on the revision of existing and development of new W3C/WAI educational resources, as part of [WAI-AGE Project Deliverables](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WAI-AGE/deliverables).
