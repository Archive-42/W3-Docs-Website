Page Structure Concepts
=======================

**Technologies covered in this Tutorial:**

<span class="tech">HTML5</span> <span class="tech">WAI-ARIA</span>

Well-structured content allows more efficient navigation and processing. Use HTML and WAI-ARIA to improve navigation and orientation on web pages and in applications.

-   **[Page Regions](regions/):** Identify and mark up regions on web pages using HTML5 and WAI-ARIA roles.

-   **[Labeling Regions](labels/):** Label regions to allow users to distinguish and access them.

-   **[Headings](headings/):** Add headings and nest them logically to label sections of web pages according to their relationships and importance.

-   **[Content Structure](content/):** Mark up the content on a page in a way that uses appropriate and meaningful elements.

Why is this important?
----------------------

Pages with well-structured content are essential for many web users, for example:

-   **People with cognitive and learning disabilities** can more easily find and prioritize content on the page.
-   **People using screen readers** can skip to the main content directly and navigate to sections that are important to them.
-   **Keyboard users** can browse pages and their sections more efficiently. Otherwise, users have to press the tab key multiple times to navigate through all links in each section.
-   **People using software that only shows the main content** of a web page, such as people with cognitive disabilities, will receive better results if the page structure is correctly marked up.
-   **People with visual impairments**, including people with low vision, have cues that provide orientation on the page and in the content.
-   **Mobile web users** often have access to a so-called “reader” or “reading” mode that will only show the main content of the page if it is correctly marked up.
-   **People using certain browser plugins** can use landmark roles to jump to specific sections on a page.
-   There are additional benefits to a good, accessible page structure, beyond those experienced by people with disabilities. As an example, search engines can use the data to better index the content of a page.

Related WCAG resources
----------------------

These tutorials provide best-practice guidance on implementing accessibility in different situations. This page combined the following WCAG success criteria and techniques from different conformance levels:

**Success Criteria:**

-   [1.3.1 Info and Relationships:](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#info-and-relationships) Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text. (Level A)

-   [2.4.1 Bypass Blocks:](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#bypass-blocks) A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple Web pages. (Level A)

-   [2.4.6 Headings and Labels:](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#headings-and-labels) Headings and labels describe topic or purpose. (Level AA)

-   [2.4.10 Section Headings:](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#section-headings) Section headings are used to organize the content. (Level AAA)

-   [<span class="count"></span><span class="txt"><span class="dir">Next:</span><span class="title">Page Regions</span></span>](regions/)
