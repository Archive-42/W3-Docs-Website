World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)
------------------------------------------------------------------

The World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) commitment to lead the web to its full potential includes promoting a high degree of usability for people with disabilities. The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is an initiative of the W3C.

WAI develops its work through W3C’s consensus-based process, involving different stakeholders in web accessibility. These include industry, disability organizations, government, accessibility research organizations, and more.

WAI, in partnership with organizations around the world, pursues accessibility of the web through these primary activities:

-   ensuring that W3C standards support accessibility
-   developing accessibility guidelines for web content and applications, browsers, and authoring tools
-   developing resources to improve web accessibility evaluation processes and tools
-   supporting education and outreach on web accessibility
-   coordinating with research and development that may impact future accessibility of the web
-   promoting harmonized international uptake of web accessibility standards
