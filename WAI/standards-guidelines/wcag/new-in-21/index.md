Introduction
------------

For an introduction to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and more about versions 2.0 and 2.1, see the [WCAG Overview](/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

All success criteria from 2.0 are included in 2.1. The 2.0 success criteria are exactly the same (verbatim, word-for-word) in 2.1.

WCAG 2.1 provides 17 additional success criteria to address:

-   [mobile accessibility](/WAI/standards-guidelines/mobile/)
-   people with low vision
-   [people with cognitive and learning disabilities](/WAI/cognitive/)

Guideline 1.3 Adaptable
-----------------------

Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.

### 1.3.4 Orientation (AA)

> Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-essential).

Comic with cerebral palsy who uses a wheelchair:

-   <span class="issue">Problem:</span>“I can't rotate my tablet — it's attached to my wheelchair.”

-   <span class="issue">Works well:</span>“The application works whether I attach my tablet horizontally or vertically.”

[Understanding Orientation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/orientation.html)

### 1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose (AA)

> The purpose of each input field collecting information about the user can be [programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-programmatically-determinable) when:
>
> -   The input field serves a purpose identified in the [Input Purposes for User Interface Components section](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-purposes); and
> -   The content is implemented using technologies with support for identifying the expected meaning for form input data.

[Supermarket assistant](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/#supermarketassistant) with dyslexia and dyscalculia:

-   <span class="issue">Problem:</span>“My address is so complicated. There's lots of numbers and long words. It's hard to type it all without making mistakes.”

-   <span class="issue">Works well:</span>“I love websites that can automatically fill it all in for me. Then I don't have to work so hard to get the numbers and spelling right.”  
    *Note:* This works because the fields use autocomplete.

[Understanding Identify Input Purpose](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html)

### 1.3.6 Identify Purpose (AAA)

> In content implemented using markup languages, the purpose of [User Interface Components](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-user-interface-components), icons, and [regions](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-regions) can be [programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-programmatically-determinable).

Gamer with language processing disability:

-   <span class="issue">Problem:</span>“I have software that changes the words in the navigation into symbols. It doesn't work at all with some websites.”

-   <span class="issue">Works well:</span>“It works pretty good with some websites.”

[Understanding Identify Purpose](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-purpose.html)

Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable
-----------------------------

Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.

### 1.4.10 Reflow (AA)

> Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for:
>
> -   Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 [CSS pixels](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-css-pixels);
> -   Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 [CSS pixels](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-css-pixels);
>
> Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.

Parent with low vision – 20/400:

-   <span class="issue">Problem:</span>“It's nearly impossible to read text if I have to scroll right and left to read each line. It's disorienting and I lose my place. It makes it hard to understand what I'm reading.”

-   <span class="issue">Works well:</span>“I increase the text size 400% and it reflowed within the width of the window. I can read it easily without scrolling back and forth.”

[Understanding Reflow](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html)

### 1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast (AA)

> The visual [presentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-presentation) of the following have a [contrast ratio](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-contrast-ratio) of at least 3:1 against adjacent color(s):
>
> User Interface Components  
> Visual information required to identify [user interface components](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-user-interface-components) and [states](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-states), except for inactive components or where the appearance of the component is determined by the user agent and not modified by the author;
>
> Graphical Objects  
> Parts of graphics required to understand the content, except when a particular presentation of graphics is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-essential) to the information being conveyed.

[Retiree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/#retiree) with low contrast sensitivity:

-   <span class="issue">Problem:</span>“I couldn't use the "Order Form" — there were no text boxes. After a long call with customer service, I learned there were text box borders that were too light for me to see.”

-   <span class="issue">Works well:</span>“It's easy for me to see all the icons and buttons and everything — even in the sunlight.”

[Understanding Non-text Contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html)

### 1.4.12 Text Spacing (AA)

> In content implemented using markup languages that support the following [text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-text) [style properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-style-properties), no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of the following and by changing no other style property:
>
> -   Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size;
> -   Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size;
> -   Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size;
> -   Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.
>
> Exception: Human languages and scripts that do not make use of one or more of these text style properties in written text can conform using only the properties that exist for that combination of language and script.

[Student](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/#classroomstudent) with dyslexia:  
and [Retiree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/#retiree) with low vision:

-   <span class="issue">Problem:</span>“Most text is hard to read. It's so cluttered I can't keep my focus. Just increasing the space between lines makes all the difference. When I'm really tired, I also increase the space between words. However, some websites don't work right — some of the text gets cut off and even buttons disappear.”

-   <span class="issue">Works well:</span>“OK, I know I'm a bit of a geek, but I've perfected a user style sheet to make text spacing just right for me. It's a relief when websites work well with my CSS.”

[Understanding Text Spacing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/text-spacing.html)

### 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus (AA)

> Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true:
>
> Dismissable  
> A [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-mechanism) is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an [input error](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-input-error) or does not obscure or replace other content;
>
> Hoverable  
> If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing;
>
> Persistent  
> The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid.
>
> Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author.

Teacher with low vision who uses screen magnification software:

-   <span class="issue">Problem:</span>“I was moving my mouse around to track what I was looking at on a web page. It helps me keep focused. Then -boom- this little box popped up. It covered what I was trying to read and I couldn't get it to go away.”

-   <span class="issue">Works well:</span>“I hovered over a word and a box popped up with the definition, but it was mostly off the screen with my magnification. I moved my mouse pointer to the definition box and scrolled the magnified area over to the definition box and it stayed popped up so I could read it.”

[Understanding Content on Hover or Focus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/content-on-hover-or-focus.html)

Guideline 2.1 Keyboard Accessible
---------------------------------

Make all functionality available from a keyboard.

### 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (A)

> If a [keyboard shortcut](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-keyboard-shortcuts) is implemented in content using only letter (including upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters, then at least one of the following is true:
>
> Turn off  
> A [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-mechanism) is available to turn the shortcut off;
>
> Remap  
> A mechanism is available to remap the shortcut to use one or more non-printable keyboard characters (e.g. Ctrl, Alt, etc).
>
> Active only on focus  
> The keyboard shortcut for a [user interface component](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-user-interface-components) is only active when that component has focus.

[Reporter](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/#reporter) with repetitive stress injury who uses voice recognition software:

-   <span class="issue">Problem:</span>“When I was using my mail app with voice commands, it kept deleting the messages instead of opening them.”  
    *Note:* There was a shortcut key for delete that was triggered by something the reporter was saying, and no way to turn off the shortcut keys.

-   <span class="issue">Works well:</span>“In my spreadsheet application, there's a setting to turn off or modify character key shortcuts.”

[Understanding Character Key Shortcuts](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/character-key-shortcuts.html)

Guideline 2.2 Enough Time
-------------------------

Provide users enough time to read and use content.

### 2.2.6 Timeouts (AAA)

> Users are warned of the duration of any [user inactivity](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-user-inactivity) that could cause data loss, unless the data is preserved for more than 20 hours when the user does not take any actions.

School playground aide with cognitive disabilities:

-   <span class="issue">Problem:</span>“I was selecting my Employee Benefits and was comparing the different plans. When I went back to select the Health Plan, it had timed out and lost all the information I had already entered.”

-   <span class="issue">Works well:</span>“When I started the Employee Benefits app, it told me how many minutes I had to complete the forms.”

[Understanding Timeouts](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/timeouts.html)

Guideline 2.3 Seizures and Physical Reactions
---------------------------------------------

Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions.

### 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions (AAA)

> [Motion animation](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-motion-animation) triggered by interaction can be disabled, unless the animation is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-essential) to the functionality or the information being conveyed.

Artist with vestibular disorder:

-   <span class="issue">Problem:</span>“In the online tax app, as I move my mouse around or tab to different fields, this little bubble with the current balance follows me around the screen. Makes me dizzy and nauseous.”

-   <span class="issue">Works well:</span>“I was so glad there was an option to turn off animations.”

[Understanding Animation from Interactions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/animation-from-interactions.html)

Guideline 2.5 Input Modalities
------------------------------

Make it easier for users to operate functionality through various inputs beyond keyboard.

### 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures (A)

> All [functionality](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-functionality) that uses multipoint or path-based gestures for operation can be operated with a [single pointer](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-single-pointer) without a path-based gesture, unless a multipoint or path-based gesture is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-essential).

Comic with cerebral palsy who has limited movement in fingers:

-   <span class="issue">Problem:</span>“I can't move my fingers like that. I need another way to zoom in the map.”

-   <span class="issue">Works well:</span>“Good thing there are buttons to zoom in and out.”

[Understanding Pointer Gestures](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-gestures.html)

### 2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation (A)

> For [functionality](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-functionality) that can be operated using a [single pointer](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-single-pointer), at least one of the following is true:
>
> No Down-Event  
> The [down-event](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-down-event) of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function;
>
> Abort or Undo  
> Completion of the function is on the [up-event](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-up-event), and a [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-mechanism) is available to abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion;
>
> Up Reversal  
> The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event;
>
> Essential  
> Completing the function on the down-event is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-essential).

Politician with motor disabilities and low vision:

-   <span class="issue">Problem:</span>“I went to hit the "Mute" button and accidentally touched the "End Call" button instead. It hung up immediately.”

-   <span class="issue">Works well:</span>“In another web conferencing application, if I accidentally touch the "End Call" button, I can just slide my finger off the "End Call" button and it won't end the call.”

[Understanding Pointer Cancellation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-cancellation.html)

### 2.5.3 Label in Name (A)

> For [user interface components](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-user-interface-components) with [labels](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-labels) that include [text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-text) or [images of text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-images-of-text), the [name](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-name) contains the text that is presented visually.

[Reporter](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/#reporter) with repetitive stress injury who uses voice recognition software:

-   <span class="issue">Problem:</span>“It understood most of my voice commands until I got to the Send button. I kept saying 'Send' and it didn't work.”  
    *Note:* It was visually labeled 'send' but the 'name' in the code was 'submit'. It would have worked if the 'name' started with 'send'.

[Understanding Label in Name](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/label-in-name.html)

### 2.5.4 Motion Actuation (A)

> [Functionality](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-functionality) that can be operated by device motion or user motion can also be operated by [user interface components](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-user-interface-components) and responding to the motion can be disabled to prevent accidental actuation, except when:
>
> Supported Interface  
> The motion is used to operate functionality through an [accessibility supported](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-accessibility-supported) interface;
>
> Essential  
> The motion is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-essential) for the function and doing so would invalidate the activity.

Comic with cerebral palsy who uses a wheelchair:

-   <span class="issue">Problem:</span>“I can't shake my phone; it's connected to my wheelchair. So there needs to be another way to activate that feature, like a button.”

-   <span class="issue">Problem:</span>“I have tremors, so I need to turn off motion activation — and then be able to do stuff without motion actuation.”

-   <span class="issue">Works well:</span>“My friend has this cool application that looks like a physical spin lock. She rotates the phone to turn to the combination. I can use the same application by typing the numbers directly.”

[Understanding Motion Actuation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/motion-actuation.html)

### 2.5.5 Target Size (AAA)

> The size of the [target](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-target) for [pointer inputs](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-pointer-inputs) is at least 44 by 44 [CSS pixels](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-css-pixels) except when:
>
> Equivalent  
> The target is available through an equivalent link or control on the same page that is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels;
>
> Inline  
> The target is in a sentence or block of text;
>
> User Agent Control  
> The size of the target is determined by the user agent and is not modified by the author;
>
> Essential  
> A particular presentation of the target is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-essential) to the information being conveyed.

[Retiree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/#retiree) with hand tremor (and big fingers):

-   <span class="issue">Problem:</span>“The buttons are so small, I hit "Cancel" when going for "Submit". Then I have to start all over again.”

-   <span class="issue">Works well:</span>“This website buttons are big enough that I don't hit the wrong button even when I'm riding on the bumpy bus.”

About the Personas Quotes
-------------------------

The linked persona roles go to the [Stories of Web Users](/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/). That page has other personas with different disabilities. We might add more in the future.

After we’ve reviewed these persona quotes sufficiently, we plan to add them to the Understanding documents.
