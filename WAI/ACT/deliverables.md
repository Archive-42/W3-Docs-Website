<span id="framework">Open Cooperation Framework</span>
------------------------------------------------------

The **Open Cooperation Framework** lowers the perceived threshold for participating in W3C/WAI efforts, to increase and leverage the skills and knowledge of European and international experts and stakeholders for WAI-ACT work. It creates an open, non-exclusive collaborative environment for the development of consensed, authoritative accessibility guidance on advanced technologies, an internationally harmonised web accessibility evaluation methodology, and a coordinate research agenda on eAccessibility. At the same time, it serves as a mechanism to disseminate iterative project results and contribute to rapid exploitation of the final results. This framework will serve as a key backbone for participation and exchange throughout the entire project.

### <span id="cooperation">Open Cooperation Forum for Transparent Dialog and Exchange</span>

The **Open Cooperation Forum** supports ongoing dialog, input, feedback, and dissemination and to build consensus on all areas of WAI-ACT work. Expected participants will include developers and practitioners, accessibility researchers and experts, people with disabilities and older users.

### <span id="collaboration">Open Collaboration Platform to Facilitate Involvement and Participation</span>

The **Open Cooperation Platform** facilitates the participation of all stakeholders in each area of WAI-ACT work. It includes improved collaboration tools such wiki-based tools, review systems, and other community-based tools with specific mechanisms to support contributions and collaborative development, facilitate discussion, knowledge sharing, and contribution by all stakeholders including individuals from the public.

<span id="implementation">Implementation Guidance</span>
--------------------------------------------------------

The publication of WCAG 2.0 as a completed web standard in December 2008, and progress of ATAG 2.0, UAAG 2.0, and WAI-ARIA 1.0 towards completed web standards, implies an increased need for more rather than less work on guidance and implementation techniques. WAI-ACT will provide authoritative technical guidance to facilitate the implementation of harmonised solutions for web accessibility, accelerating direct progress on development of accessible web content, and increasing the potential for indirect impact through development of authoring tools that support production of accessible web content.

### <span id="axs_support">Repository of Information on Accessibility Support in Web Technologies</span>

The **repository of information on accessibility support in web technologies** will guide the selection of technologies during the development of accessible websites and web applications. For instance, to help select web technologies that provide support for captions, keyboard support, and support for text alternatives for images with certain combinations of browsers and assistive technologies. This repository will be provided using collaborative tools developed through the Open Collaboration Platform that facilitate public input and contribution, to continually expand the repository with updated and new information on accessibility support in web technologies.

<span id="evaluation">Evaluation Methodologies</span>
-----------------------------------------------------

Part of the technical guidance needed is an authoritative and broadly consensed evaluation methodology for web accessibility. To date many organisations, projects, and activities have developed evaluation guidance based on W3C/WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0. Several of these methodologies bear conflicting interpretations of the guidelines, do not have broad consensus and recognition as authoritative resources, or have otherwise not been widely adopted by different stakeholders.

WAI-ACT will provide an authoritative and internationally harmonised methodology for evaluating web accessibility that is based on WCAG 2.0 will supersede previous methodologies based WCAG 1.0 and will contribute to a common understanding of accessibility solutions. It will facilitate the uniform uptake of W3C/WAI standards and guidelines in Europe and internationally, and accelerate the implementation of web accessibility.

### <span id="methodology">Methodology for Evaluating Conformance of Websites to WCAG 2.0</span>

An internationally harmonised **methodology for evaluating conformance of websites to WCAG 2.0** defines a consensed approach and metrics for evaluating the conformance of entire websites, including web applications, to WCAG 2.0. It promotes common interpretation and harmonised uptake of WCAG 2.0 among EU Member States and internationally.

<span id="research">Research Agenda Setting</span>
--------------------------------------------------

The convergence of the Web with media and technologies such as television, telephony, and mobile devices; the increased use of gestures, sensors, and biometrics for web-based human computer interaction; the evolution of web applications and cloud computing; the emergence of 3D, augmented reality, and virtual reality on the Web; and many more technology trends adds to the need for coordinated research and development on eAccessibility. WAI-ACT contributes to coordinated research on the application of the second generation of W3C/WAI web accessibility standards and guidelines to converging technologies including media is needed to keep pace with the accelerating development of ICTs that are accessible to people with disabilities. This will be embedded into interdisciplinary and pro-active research aspects on HCI, usability, and socio-economic impacts for the information society.

### <span id="seminars">Teleconference Seminars to Explore eAccessibility Research Topics</span>

Regular **teleconference seminars to explore eAccessibility research topics** bring European and international researchers and experts together through planning, organisation of topics and speakers, and holding teleconference seminars on eAccessibility.
