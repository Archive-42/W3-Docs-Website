<span id="current">Project Work</span>
--------------------------------------

The WAI-DEV project ended on 31 March 2016. The [project deliverables](deliverables) include the following:

-   Providing guidance on the interrelationships between accessibility and inclusion ([Deliverable D1.1](deliverables#guide))
-   Embedding accessibility considerations in mainstream web developer platforms ([Deliverable D1.2](deliverables#articles))
-   Developing showcase examples with videos on accessible and inclusive design ([Deliverable D2.1](deliverables#examples) and [Deliverable D2.2](deliverables#videos))
-   Establishing a crowd-sourced gallery of accessible widgets and other components ([Deliverable D2.3](deliverables#gallery))
-   Providing a dynamic guide to support planning and managing web accessibility ([Deliverable D3.1](deliverables#managing))
-   Creating quick start guides to help key stakeholders get started with accessibility ([Deliverable D3.2](deliverables#conisderations))
-   Updating the How to Meet WCAG 2.0 quick reference, to make it more dynamic ([Deliverable D3.3](deliverables#quickref))

<span id="participate">How To Participate</span>

<span id="about">About WAI-DEV</span>
-------------------------------------

WAI-DEV was a coordination and support action project, co-funded by the European Commission as a Specific Support Action under the IST 7th Framework Programme. The project started on 1 April 2014 for a duration of two years. It was lead by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI, to:

-   Develop strategies to support mainstream production of inclusive components and services;
-   Demonstrate the potential economic value and showcase good practice in inclusive design;
-   Support enhanced policy strategies for consistent adoption and implementation of accessibility.

WAI-DEV primarily targeted the Web as the essential technical platform and universal interface for information and communication technology (ICT) through which to address the accessibility of advanced technologies and delivery channels including those for mobile devices, portable computers, digital television, telephony, and more. It built upon recent technical and policy advancements in accessibility and on the cross-cutting benefits of accessibility for everyone regardless of age, gender, software, hardware, connectivity, language, literacy, digital skills, social and economic situations, and physical and mental abilities. It will thereby facilitate more mainstream market adoption of accessible and inclusive design-for-all practices throughout the production chain, and support implementation of accessibility policies and targets set by the European Commission and EU Member States.
