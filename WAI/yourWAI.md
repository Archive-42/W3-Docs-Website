**For managers, policy makers, presenters, developers, designers, people with disabilities and others**, the WAI website has a wide range of resources, such as:

-   [**Web Accessibility Perspectives**: Explore the Impact and Benefits for Everyone](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspectives/) with videos
-   [**Tips for Getting Started** with Web Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted/tips/)
-   [Web Accessibility **Tutorials**](http://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/)
-   [**Easy Checks** - A First Review of Web Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/preliminary)
-   [WCAG-EM **Report Tool**: Website Accessibility Evaluation Report Generator](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/report-tool/#/)

Please look around the WAI website and find more information that is useful to you. This page explains strategies for finding what you're looking for. (A separate page provides [Help with the WAI Web Site](http://www.w3.org/WAI/sitehelp.html), such as navigating with headings.)

<span id="highlights"></span>See Resource Announcements
-------------------------------------------------------

For past announcements of new resources and draft resources in development, see the [WAI Highlights Archive](http://www.w3.org/WAI/highlights/archive).

To get future announcements via e-mail, Twitter, or RSS feed, see [Getting WAI Announcements](/WAI/about/announcements).

<span id="looknav"></span>Look through the Website Navigation
-------------------------------------------------------------

In most visual browsers the navigation is in the light blue box on the left of most pages. Screen reader users and those without CSS can find the navigation under "Site Navigation" heading level two.

When you click on a navigation topic (Getting Started, Designing for Inclusion, Guidelines & Techniques, etc.) you get a page that briefly explains the documents that are listed under that navigation topic.

<span id="sitemap"></span>Use the Resources List or Site Map
------------------------------------------------------------

1.  **Go to either the**
    -   **[WAI Resources](https://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/Overview)** for an annotated list of the primary resources
    -   **[WAI Site Map](http://www.w3.org/WAI/sitemap)** for a complete list of documents/pages
2.  **Use the Find-on-page functionality to look for a specific word.**  
    Find is often under the "Edit" menu, and the shortcut key for it is often Ctrl+F. Some browsers pop up a Find dialog box. Others add a strip at the top or bottom of the browser where you enter the words to find.

<span id="search"></span>Standard Search
----------------------------------------

We do not have an optimized general search. The information in [Searching the WAI Web Site](http://www.w3.org/WAI/search.php) might help some.

Can't Find it?
--------------

<span id="email"></span>If you don't find what you're looking for or have any suggestions on what you do find, please let us know by sending e-mail to:

-   <wai-eo-editors@w3.org> if you want your e-mail publicly archived.
-   <wai@w3.org> if you want your e-mail to go only to WAI staff. Please indicate if we may forward it to a public list anonymously, with your name and contact information removed.

<span id="networking"></span>Share Resources
