  <A name="mission">1. Mission</A>
</H2>
<P>
The mission of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) working group
is twofold:
<OL>
  <LI>
    to produce Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0;
  <LI>
    to document accessible techniques for W3C Recommendations (such as XML, RDF,
    SMIL, SVG, and MathML) as well as specific other Web technologies such as
    ECMA Script
</OL>
<P>
as guidance for Web content authors and developers to create Web content
that is accessible and usable by the widest audience possible.
<P>
These activities continue W3C's work on guidelines for creating accessible
content that began with
<A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505/">WCAG
1.0</A><A></A>. The history of this group has been documented in the
"<A href="end-charter2-report.html">End of Charter Report for the Web Content
Guidelines Working Group</A>." Also, refer to our
<A href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/charter.html">previous charter</A>.
<P>
This work is part of the
<A href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/Technical/Activity.html">WAI Technical
Activity</A>.
<H2>
  <A name="scope">2. Scope</A>
</H2>
<H3>
  2.1 Focus of activities
</H3>
<P>
The WCAG WG will:
<UL>
  <LI>
    produce next-generation normative guidelines for accessibility of Web content,
    including addressing issues of clarity raised since publication of WCAG 1.0;
  <LI>
    collect, test, discuss and create techniques for WCAG-conformant content
    in XML, RDF, SMIL, SVG, MathML and other W3C Recommendations and scripting
    languages not yet addressed in the Techniques document;
  <LI>
    produce updated non-normative supporting documents, including techniques
    documents and implementation tracking information;
  <LI>
    coordinate with other groups including W3C groups writing guidelines, and
    EOWG regarding ease-of-use considerations in WCAG WG's development of WCAG
    2.0.
</UL>
<H3>
  2.2 Intended audience of deliverables
</H3>
<P>
Since the release of WCAG 1.0, a number of readers have raised ease-of-use
concerns with the format and language of WCAG 1.0, given diverse audiences
which must rely on this document, including non-technical audiences. It has
also become clear that authoring tool and user agent developers also form
part of the technical audience of this document when implementing the Authoring
Tool Accessibility Guidelines and the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines.
<P>
With regard to the WCAG WG's guidelines document, the Working Group will
produce a document with sufficient technical precision to be used as a normative
reference for Web content accessibility, and with language accessible to
non-technical audiences. Ease-of-use considerations may be accomplished through
layering multiple documents in a set, or by integrating understandable language
throughout the document, or by some other means, but are a fundamental part
of the guidelines document requirements.
<H2>
  <A name="duration">3. Duration</A>
</H2>
<P>
The Working Group is scheduled for 18 months, from November 2000 through
May 2002.
<H2>
  <A name="deliverables">4. Deliverables</A>
</H2>
<OL>
  <LI>
    Requirements document for the next version of the Web Content Accessibility
    Guidelines.
  <LI>
    Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (W3C Recommendation) and supporting
    documents (Errata, translations to other languages, documentation of impact
    decisions, checklist of checkpoints).
  <LI>
    Revised and more comprehensive Techniques for Web Content Accessibility
    Guidelines (W3C Note).
  <LI>
    <A href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/WAI-UA-Support">User Agent Support
    for Accessibility</A> (W3C Note)
    <UL>
      <LI>
	The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 include a number of checkpoints
	that require content developers to create pages in a particular manner "until
	user agents" do the work for them. This page documents user agent support
	for those checkpoints and includes additional Resources for UA support
    </UL>
  <LI>
    Ongoing documentation of open issues.
  <LI>
    Working Drafts of all Deliverables.
  <LI>
    Minutes from WCAG WG meetings.
  <LI>
    End of charter report: Discuss the accomplishments and impact of the working
    group, as well as further work that is needed, if any.
</OL>
<H2>
  <A name="success">5. Success</A>
</H2>
<P>
To be considered successful, this Working Group must:
<UL>
  <LI>
    deliver the set of documents described in the "Deliverables" section;
  <LI>
    test every proposed technique for the Techniques document for efficacy and
    technical feasibility.
</UL>
<H2>
  <A name="schedule">6. Schedule</A>
</H2>
<P>
A list of active working drafts is maintained by the chairs and staff contact.
These drafts are maintained by editors assigned by the chair. Changes to
editing assignments may be negotiated with the chair at any time.
<P>
All participants are encouraged to draft proposed text and techniques for
active working drafts. Proposals should be sent to the mailing list for
consideration by the working group.
<P>
The following schedules are expected to be followed:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Internal Working Drafts should be published at least on a monthly basis.
    Internal Working Drafts are available to the public, but have not been reviewed
    by the WAI Interest Group and are not published on the W3C Technical Reports
    page.
  <LI>
    Public Working Drafts should be published at least every three months (per
    the Release Policy). These differ from Internal Working Drafts in that they
    have been reviewed by the WAI Interest Group and are published on the W3C
    Technical Reports page.
  <LI>
    Face to Face meetings should occur quarterly.
</UL>
<P>
A <A href="timeline.html">detailed, proposed timeline</A> is available.
<H2>
  <A name="confidentiality">7. Confidentiality</A>
</H2>
<P>
Group proceedings, e-mail list, archives, charter, and deliverables are all
public.
<H2>
  <A name="dependencies">8. Coordination</A>
</H2>
<P>
This group coordinates activity with other WAI Working Groups through the
<A href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/CG/Group">WAI Coordination Group</A> [Members
only] and through the WAI's participation in the
<A href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/CoordGroup/">Hypertext Coordination Group</A>
[Members only].
<H3>
  8.1 Protocols and Formats
</H3>
<P>
The WCAG working group develops guidelines to educate content developers
about accessible authoring practices for HTML 4.0, CSS1 and CSS2, XML, SMIL,
etc. This work relies on the investigations of the
<A href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/">Protocols and Formats Working Group</A>
(PFWG) to lead us into the recent work of other W3C working groups. Once
PFWG has identified or worked through an accessibility barrier with a
specification, we should reflect the new information in our deliverables.
For example, many of the XML and SVG authoring practices have been identified
by PFWG. The Web Content Guidelines Working Group needs to incorporate these
practices into the Techniques for WCAG document.
<P>
Likewise, the Protocols and Formats Working Group takes requirements for
accessibility identified in this working group and negotiates with the relevant
W3C groups where appropriate.
<H3>
  8.2 Authoring Tools
</H3>
<P>
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines need to be usable by content authors
and developers. Since many content authors are not technically savvy, the
adoption of the guidelines is dependent on authoring tools that support WCAG
authoring practices. Adoption of the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
by authoring tool developers is a key step.
<P>
Likewise, the <A href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU">Authoring Tools Guidelines
Working Group</A> (AU) uses the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines as a
core piece of the Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines.When needed, the
WCAG WG clarifies points in WCAG 1.0 and reviews AU work to ensure that
accessible authoring practices are supported.
<H3>
  8.3 User Agents
</H3>
<P>
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are dependent on how user agents
interpret markup as well as how well an assistive technology (where needed)
is able to make use of content. Therefore, our work is also dependent on
the adoption of the WAI User Agent Accessibility Guidelines.
<P>
Likewise, the <A href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA">User Agent Guidelines Working
Group</A> (UA) should address how to take advantage of content that conforms
to WCAG 1.0. When needed the WCAG WG clarifies points in WCAG 1.0, and reviews
UA work to ensure that accessible authoring practices are supported.
<H3>
  8.4 Evaluation and Repair Tools
</H3>
<P>
Until WAI guidelines are widely adopted, the prototype tools identified,
developed, or collected by the <A href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER">Evaluation
and Repair Tools Working Group</A> (ERT WG) will help promote the adoption
of the guidelines by authors and users. Currently, the ERT WG is developing
evaluation and validation tool techniques for each checkpoint in the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0. Oftentimes, the ERT WG requests
clarifications or interpretations of checkpoints.
<H3>
  8.5 Education and Outreach
</H3>
<P>
Among its promotion and education work, the
<A href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/">Education and Outreach Working Group
</A>(EOWG) develops some promotional and educational materials based on the
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and other WCAG WG deliverables. The
EOWG relies on the WCAG WG to review any derivative promotional or educational
material it produces that is based on WCAG or other WCAG WG deliverables.
The WCAG WG relies on EOWG to help advise with regard to ease-of-use
considerations around WCAG deliverables, particularly for its normative
guidelines.
<H3>
  8.6 Mobile, TV and Internationalization
</H3>
<P>
The WCAG working group needs to maintain contact with the W3C
<A href="http://www.w3.org/Mobile/">Mobile Activity</A>, the
<A href="http://www.w3.org/TV/">TV/Web
Activity</A><A href="http://www.w3.org/Mobile/"> </A>and the W3C
<A href="http://www.w3.org/International/">Internationalization Activity</A>
(I18N) as these groups develop content guidelines related to their activities.
This contact should be coordinated through the WAI CG chair who also sits
on the Hypertext CG, and through direct liaison with Mobile and I18N as needed.
<H3>
  8.7 Other W3C Groups
</H3>
<P>
When developing techniques for other W3C specifications, WCAG WG's work may
also require direct coordination with the following working groups or
coordination groups. The following links are to the member only areas for
each of these working groups.

  8.8 External organizations
</H3>
<P>
In addition, external organizations such as ISO, IEEE, national governments,
corporations, etc., may reference the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
Externally developed tools such as CAST's
"<A href="http://www.cast.org/bobby/">Bobby</A>" may use the guidelines as
the basis for their site evaluation tools. Coordination with external groups
referencing the guidelines is primarily through the WAI International Program
Office. Coordination with groups using WCAG WG deliverables as the basis
of evaluation or repair tools is shared between this group and the Evaluation
and Repair Tools Working Group.
