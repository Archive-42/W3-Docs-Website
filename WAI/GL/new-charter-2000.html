    <h2>
      <a name="mission">1. Mission</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The mission of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) working
      group is twofold:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>to produce Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0;</li>

      <li>
        to document accessible techniques for W3C Recommendations (such as XML,
        RDF, SMIL, SVG, and MathML) as well as specific other Web technologies
        such as ECMA Script
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      as guidance for Web content authors and developers to create Web content
      that is accessible and usable by the widest audience possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      These activities continue W3C's work on guidelines for creating accessible
      content that began with
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505/">WCAG 1.0</a
      ><a></a>. The history of this group has been documented in the "<a
        href="end-charter2-report.html"
        >End of Charter Report for the Web Content Guidelines Working Group</a
      >." Also, refer to our
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/charter.html">previous charter</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This work is part of the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/Technical/Activity.html"
        >WAI Technical Activity</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="scope">2. Scope</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>2.1 Focus of activities</h3>
    <p>The WCAG WG will:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        produce next-generation normative guidelines for accessibility of Web
        content, including addressing issues of clarity raised since publication
        of WCAG 1.0;
      </li>

      <li>
        collect, test, discuss and create techniques for WCAG-conformant content
        in XML, RDF, SMIL, SVG, MathML and other W3C Recommendations and
        scripting languages not yet addressed in the Techniques document;
      </li>

      <li>
        produce updated non-normative supporting documents, including techniques
        documents and implementation tracking information;
      </li>

      <li>
        coordinate with other groups including W3C groups writing guidelines,
        and EOWG regarding ease-of-use considerations in WCAG WG's development
        of WCAG 2.0.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Intended audience of deliverables</h3>
    <p>
      Since the release of WCAG 1.0, a number of readers have raised ease-of-use
      concerns with the format and language of WCAG 1.0, given diverse audiences
      which must rely on this document, including non-technical audiences. It
      has also become clear that authoring tool and user agent developers also
      form part of the technical audience of this document when implementing the
      Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines and the User Agent Accessibility
      Guidelines.
    </p>

    <p>
      With regard to the WCAG WG's guidelines document, the Working Group will
      produce a document with sufficient technical precision to be used as a
      normative reference for Web content accessibility, and with language
      accessible to non-technical audiences. Ease-of-use considerations may be
      accomplished through layering multiple documents in a set, or by
      integrating understandable language throughout the document, or by some
      other means, but are a fundamental part of the guidelines document
      requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="duration">3. Duration</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Working Group is scheduled for 18 months, from November 2000 through
      May 2002.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="deliverables">4. Deliverables</a>
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Requirements document for the next version of the Web Content
        Accessibility Guidelines.
      </li>

      <li>
        Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (W3C Recommendation) and
        supporting documents (Errata, translations to other languages,
        documentation of impact decisions, checklist of checkpoints).
      </li>

      <li>
        Revised and more comprehensive Techniques for Web Content Accessibility
        Guidelines (W3C Note).
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/WAI-UA-Support"
          >User Agent Support for Accessibility</a
        >
        (W3C Note)
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 include a number of
            checkpoints that require content developers to create pages in a
            particular manner "until user agents" do the work for them. This
            page documents user agent support for those checkpoints and includes
            additional Resources for UA support
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Ongoing documentation of open issues.</li>

      <li>Working Drafts of all Deliverables.</li>

      <li>Minutes from WCAG WG meetings.</li>

      <li>
        End of charter report: Discuss the accomplishments and impact of the
        working group, as well as further work that is needed, if any.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>
      <a name="success">5. Success</a>
    </h2>
    <p>To be considered successful, this Working Group must:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        deliver the set of documents described in the "Deliverables" section;
      </li>

      <li>
        test every proposed technique for the Techniques document for efficacy
        and technical feasibility.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
      <a name="schedule">6. Schedule</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      A list of active working drafts is maintained by the chairs and staff
      contact. These drafts are maintained by editors assigned by the chair.
      Changes to editing assignments may be negotiated with the chair at any
      time.
    </p>

    <p>
      All participants are encouraged to draft proposed text and techniques for
      active working drafts. Proposals should be sent to the mailing list for
      consideration by the working group.
    </p>

    <p>The following schedules are expected to be followed:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Internal Working Drafts should be published at least on a monthly basis.
        Internal Working Drafts are available to the public, but have not been
        reviewed by the WAI Interest Group and are not published on the W3C
        Technical Reports page.
      </li>

      <li>
        Public Working Drafts should be published at least every three months
        (per the Release Policy). These differ from Internal Working Drafts in
        that they have been reviewed by the WAI Interest Group and are published
        on the W3C Technical Reports page.
      </li>

      <li>Face to Face meetings should occur quarterly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A <a href="timeline.html">detailed, proposed timeline</a> is available.

    <h2>
      <a name="dependencies">8. Coordination</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      This group coordinates activity with other WAI Working Groups through the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/CG/Group">WAI Coordination Group</a>
      [Members only] and through the WAI's participation in the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/CoordGroup/"
        >Hypertext Coordination Group</a
      >
      [Members only].
    </p>

    <h3>8.1 Protocols and Formats</h3>
    <p>
      The WCAG working group develops guidelines to educate content developers
      about accessible authoring practices for HTML 4.0, CSS1 and CSS2, XML,
      SMIL, etc. This work relies on the investigations of the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/"
        >Protocols and Formats Working Group</a
      >
      (PFWG) to lead us into the recent work of other W3C working groups. Once
      PFWG has identified or worked through an accessibility barrier with a
      specification, we should reflect the new information in our deliverables.
      For example, many of the XML and SVG authoring practices have been
      identified by PFWG. The Web Content Guidelines Working Group needs to
      incorporate these practices into the Techniques for WCAG document.
    </p>

    <p>
      Likewise, the Protocols and Formats Working Group takes requirements for
      accessibility identified in this working group and negotiates with the
      relevant W3C groups where appropriate.
    </p>

    <h3>8.2 Authoring Tools</h3>
    <p>
      The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines need to be usable by content
      authors and developers. Since many content authors are not technically
      savvy, the adoption of the guidelines is dependent on authoring tools that
      support WCAG authoring practices. Adoption of the Authoring Tool
      Accessibility Guidelines by authoring tool developers is a key step.
    </p>

    <p>
      Likewise, the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU"
        >Authoring Tools Guidelines Working Group</a
      >
      (AU) uses the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines as a core piece of the
      Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines.When needed, the WCAG WG
      clarifies points in WCAG 1.0 and reviews AU work to ensure that accessible
      authoring practices are supported.
    </p>

    <h3>8.3 User Agents</h3>
    <p>
      The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are dependent on how user agents
      interpret markup as well as how well an assistive technology (where
      needed) is able to make use of content. Therefore, our work is also
      dependent on the adoption of the WAI User Agent Accessibility Guidelines.
    </p>

    <p>
      Likewise, the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA">User Agent Guidelines Working Group</a>
      (UA) should address how to take advantage of content that conforms to WCAG
      1.0. When needed the WCAG WG clarifies points in WCAG 1.0, and reviews UA
      work to ensure that accessible authoring practices are supported.
    </p>

    <h3>8.4 Evaluation and Repair Tools</h3>
    <p>
      Until WAI guidelines are widely adopted, the prototype tools identified,
      developed, or collected by the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER"
        >Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group</a
      >
      (ERT WG) will help promote the adoption of the guidelines by authors and
      users. Currently, the ERT WG is developing evaluation and validation tool
      techniques for each checkpoint in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
      1.0. Oftentimes, the ERT WG requests clarifications or interpretations of
      checkpoints.
    </p>

    <h3>8.5 Education and Outreach</h3>
    <p>
      Among its promotion and education work, the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/"
        >Education and Outreach Working Group </a
      >(EOWG) develops some promotional and educational materials based on the
      Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and other WCAG WG deliverables. The
      EOWG relies on the WCAG WG to review any derivative promotional or
      educational material it produces that is based on WCAG or other WCAG WG
      deliverables. The WCAG WG relies on EOWG to help advise with regard to
      ease-of-use considerations around WCAG deliverables, particularly for its
      normative guidelines.
    </p>

    <h3>8.6 Mobile, TV and Internationalization</h3>
    <p>
      The WCAG working group needs to maintain contact with the W3C
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/Mobile/">Mobile Activity</a>, the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TV/">TV/Web Activity</a
      ><a href="http://www.w3.org/Mobile/"> </a>and the W3C
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/"
        >Internationalization Activity</a
      >
      (I18N) as these groups develop content guidelines related to their
      activities. This contact should be coordinated through the WAI CG chair
      who also sits on the Hypertext CG, and through direct liaison with Mobile
      and I18N as needed.
    </p>

    <h3>8.7 Other W3C Groups</h3>
    <p>
      When developing techniques for other W3C specifications, WCAG WG's work
      may also require direct coordination with the following working groups or
      coordination groups. The following links are to the member only areas for
      each of these working groups.

    <h3>8.8 External organizations</h3>
    <p>
      In addition, external organizations such as ISO, IEEE, national
      governments, corporations, etc., may reference the Web Content
      Accessibility Guidelines. Externally developed tools such as CAST's "<a
        href="http://www.cast.org/bobby/"
        >Bobby</a
      >" may use the guidelines as the basis for their site evaluation tools.
      Coordination with external groups referencing the guidelines is primarily
      through the WAI International Program Office. Coordination with groups
      using WCAG WG deliverables as the basis of evaluation or repair tools is
      shared between this group and the Evaluation and Repair Tools Working
      Group.
