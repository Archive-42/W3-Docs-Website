            There is no difference between 2.1.1 and 2.1.3 if a Web page does
            not contain content that uses analogue input (i.e. the underlying
            function requires input that depends on the path of the user's
            movement and not just the endpoints). <br />
            <br />
            Question: <br />
            <br />
            a. If all functionality on such a Web page is keyboard-accessible,
            does it automatically meet AAA SC 2.1.3?<br />
            <br />
            b. Conversely, can one argue that making such a Web page
            keyboard-accessible is only a "AAA" requirement and disregard it as
            a "A" level requirement? <br />
            <br />

            If the answer to (a) is "Yes" and (b) above is "No", I feel that The
            reason for repeating the requirement at 2.1.3 is unclear or even
            futile.<br />
            <br />
            In that event I reiterate that 2.1.3 be dropped and 2.1.1 be
            re-stated as: <br />
            <br />
            SC2.1.1: All functionality of the content is operable through a
            keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual
            keystrokes.<br />
            This does not apply to content that uses analogue input (i.e. the
            underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the
            user's movement and<br />
            not just the endpoints).<br />
            <br />
            (I recall I had made this suggestion to TIETAC too).
          </td>
          <td width="50%" class="detail">
            The answer to (a) is "yes". If a Web page does not contain content
            that uses analogue input, then if it meets 2.1.1, it will also meet
            2.1.3.
            <br />

            <br />
            The answer to (b) is "no". The Level A success criterion must be
            satisfied to conform at Level A. That it also satisfies a Level AAA
            success criterion is immaterial for Level A conformance.
            <br />

            <br />
            Note, of course, that your questions were limited to Web pages that
            do not contain analogue input. For pages which do contain analogue
            input, satisfying 2.1.1 does not also satisfy 2.1.3.
            <br />

            <br />
            Your proposed restatement of 2.1.1 is equivalent to the current
            success criterion 2.1.1. If 2.1.3 were dropped, then Web pages that
            contain analogue input would conform at Level AAA. The purpose of
            2.1.3 is to ensure that all content is keyboard operable.
            <br />

            <br />
            At level A, it is permissible to have content that requires
            time-dependant analog input without providing a keyboard accessible
            alternative. This is not permissible at Level AAA because of 2.1.3.

            In attempting to harmonize ATAG 2.0's "Guideline A.2.2 [For the
            <br />

            authoring tool user interface] Display synchronized alternatives for
            <br />

            <br />
            Provide alternatives for time-based media" I found the WCAG
            guideline <br />
            confusing because it's bold labels mix the media types to be made
            <br />
            accessible (e,g,"Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded):") with the

            ways this can be done (e.g. "Sign Language").<br />

            I think it makes the most sense to follow the lead of WCAG Guideline

            The handles (bold labels) for each success criterion are meant to be
            unique, so that they can be a shorthand for referring to the success

            proposed reorganization reuses handles, since different conformance
            levels include different requirements for the same media types.

            We noticed that WCAG 2.0 advanced to a candidate recommendation even
            though we have not received a follow up response to one of the
            issues we raised (which remains unresolved in the candidate
            recommendation). The issue in question is the one that we raised on
            April 9 (<a

            definition (which is a continuation of the absence of support for
            programmatic objects issue that we raised earlier).<br />

            <br />
            Are you still considering our recommendation for resolving this
            issue or was the issue that we raised previously accidentally

            <br />
            We agree that a technology (such as JavaScript) cannot be considered
            an accessibility supported technology if one or more of the
            supported environments requires that technology to be disabled.
            <br />
            <br />
            We also agree that a technology cannot be considered an
            accessibility supported technology if one or more of the supported
            user agents (such as cell phones, PDAs, or specialized browsers)
            cannot support the technology natively or through a
            widely-distributed plugin.<br />
            <br />
            The problem is that these requirements are not clear in the
            "accessibility supported" definition (<a
              href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#accessibility-supporteddef"
              >http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#accessibility-supporteddef</a
            >). <br />

            <br />
            We recommend including the following wording in the "accessibility
            supported" definition and to also add "environment" to the glossary
            as it is used repeatedly throughout WCAG 2.0 and the meaning can be
            a bit unclear: <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            3. The Web content technology is not restricted in any of the
            supported environments. This means that all of the following are
            true:<br />
            <br />
            a) The technology is either supported natively or supported through
            widely distributed plugins for all of the supported user agents in
            the supported environments; AND<br />
            b) The technology is not restricted from being installed, enabled,
            or used in any of the supported environments; AND<br />
            c) The supported user agents, widely distributed plugins, and other
            technologies required to provide support for the technology are not
            restricted from being installed, enabled, or used in any of the
            supported environments.<br />

            &gt; B) CONCERNS WITH COMMENT 3 RESPONSE<br />
            &gt;<br />
            &gt; Quote from the Comment 3 response:<br />
            &gt; "The situations you describe are addressed differently in WCAG
            2.0 than in 1.0. WCAG 2.0 has an improved set of conformance
            requirements. Refer to
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conformance-reqs."
              >http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conformance-reqs.</a
            >
            We believe this is a more effective and thorough approach."<br />
            &gt;<br />
            &gt; The problem is that the conformance requirements do not cover a
            technology being disabled or unavailable resulting in accessibility
            issues, it only covers whether a technology is
            "accessibility-supported" or not which only deals with compatibility
            with assistive technologies.<br />

            &gt;<br />
            &gt; a) What about users with cell phones and other Internet-enabled
            devices? The way things are worded now, you could make JavaScript
            rendered content that is fully accessible to assistive technologies
            and keyboard users yet unavailable when JavaScript is disabled and
            the page could still achieve full compliance.<br />
            &gt;<br />
            &gt; b) What if the device does not support the required plugin
            (such as Flash)? There could be an accessibility supported plugin
            that is available for normal browsers but are not available for
            certain devices resulting in Web pages. This would meet the
            conformance requirements but still result in content being
            unavailable to certain users.<br />
            &gt;<br />
            &gt; Ultimately the conformance requirements as they are worded now
            leave many loopholes where sites can be completely inaccessible and
            unusable on certain user agents yet still be fully compliant (such
            as a fully JavaScript-rendered site that is fully accessible to
            assistive technologies but just an empty page on a handheld device
            that does not support JavaScript or secure environments where
            JavaScript is disabled).<br />
            &gt;<br />
            &gt; RECOMMENDATION: Either expand "Accessibility-Supported
            Technologies" conformance requirement to cover the case where an
            accessibility-supported technology is disabled or the required
            accessibility-plugin is not supported by the widely distributed user
            agent (cell phones and Internet-enabled devices are pretty common
            but most do not support Flash or JavaScript).<br />
            &gt;<br />

            <br />
            ---------------------------------------------<br />
            Response from Working Group:<br />
            ---------------------------------------------<br />
            If a technology is not supported on the users' user agents
            (including<br />
            such user agents as cell phones or Internet-enabled devices), then
            the<br />
            technology is not accessibility supported. If an author is
            producing<br />
            content for a secure environment where Javascript is disabled,
            then<br />
            the author cannot rely on Javascript. Determining the range of

            agents used in an environment is a challenge, but one which
            authors<br />
            must already face. It is important that information about which
            user<br />
            agents and assistive technologies support different technologies
            be<br />
            available to authors, so they understand the environment for
            which<br />
            they are producing content.<br />
            <br />
            Authors cannot control whether or not a user disables a
            technology<br />
            such as Javascript or fails to load a plug-in that is available
            to<br />
            users. As long as the conformance claim documents which
            technologies<br />

            are relied upon, and as long as the user agents can support that<br />
            technology, the author has met the accessibility-supported<br />
            requirements of WCAG 2.0<br />
            <br />
            Thanks again for the interest that you have taken in these
            guidelines.<br />

            Our apologies for leaving this dangling. We believed that we had

            In the WCAG 2.0 supporting document, “Understanding Conformance”
            there is a discussion about the conditions for a WCAG 2.0 Success
            Criteria. The text is as follows:
            <br />

            <br />
            "All Success Criteria must be important access issues for people
            with disabilities that address problems beyond the usability
            problems that might be faced by all users. In other words, the
            access issue must cause a proportionately greater problem for people
            with disabilities than it causes people without disabilities in
            order to be considered an accessibility issue (and covered under
            these accessibility guidelines)."
            <br />

              >http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20-20080505/intro.html</a

            <br />

            <br />
            Taking the example you've provided, if the use of JavaScript is
            incompatible with handheld devices (and creating a blank page), then
            nobody will be able to access the content (regardless of ability)
            and therefore it is a global problem affecting all users. It would
            not affect people with disabilities disproportionately, and as such
            it falls beyond the scope of WCAG. This would also be true in
            environments where JavaScript is prohibited in a secure government
            environment. No one could access the content.
            <br />

            <br />
            In order for content to conform, SC 2.1.1 requires it must be
            keyboard accessible regardless of technology. Success Criteria 1.1.1
            requires it be available in text. We believe the current language of
            Accessibility-Supported covers closed environments where conforming
            content is targeted for that environment.
            <br />

            <br />
            The definition of Accessibility Supported is already complex. We
            believe that introducing policy constraints (such as those in a
            closed environment) as well as technical constraints into the
            definition will make it more difficult to understand.

            HTML technique H48 deals with marking up lists. One of the tests
            is:<br />
            "Check that content that has the visual appearance of a bulleted
            list is<br />
            marked as an unordered list".<br />
            Comment: Even when bullets are not used, a sighted user can still<br />
            determine that certain items make up a list. For instance, top-nav
            or footer<br />
            links placed in one line horizontally. A sighted user would be able
            to<br />

            relate these items as a group of n items.<br />
            These should also be marked up as a list with no bullets.<br />
            So I suggest that the test should be worded as:<br />
            "Check that content that has the visual appearance of a list (with /
            without<br />
            bullets) is marked as an unordered list".

            Changes of context are initiated only by user request or a mechanism

            available to turn off such changes. (Level AAA)<br />
            Comment:<br />

            3.2 deals with making Web page content behave in predictable ways
            and the<br />
            emphasis is on consistent layout, navigation and identification.
            This is in<br />
            keeping with the "understanding" principle.<br />
            I believe a change in context caused by auto updating content
            (3.2.5) is<br />
            covered by interruptions (2.2.4) that upset task focus. Such an<br />
            interruption or change in context makes it difficult to operate (or
            even<br />
            read) the Web page. So change of context by auto updating content is
            a<br />
            transgression of the "operate" principle than the "understand"
            principle.<br />

            Difficulty in understanding posed by auto updating content is a
            consequence<br />
            of difficulties posed during operation.<br />
            On the other hand, changes in context referred to 3.2.1 or 3.2.2 are
            also<br />
            unexpected but are based on user action (focus change / form input)
            and<br />
            certainly hamper understanding. As a consequence it makes
            operation<br />
            difficult.<br />
            The supporting techniques for 2.2.4 and 3.2.5 too are identical:<br />
            G75 for 2.2.4: Providing a mechanism to postpone any updating of
            content<br />
            G76 for 3.2.5: Providing a mechanism to request an update of the
            content<br />

            instead of updating automatically<br />
            <br />
            I think this is just a play of words and both SC 3.2.5 and technique
            G76<br />
            can be deleted without any loss.

            <br />
            While we agree that listing automatic updates under 3.2.5 (Change on
            Request)
            <br />
            overlaps somewhat with the requirements of 2.2.4 (Interruptions),
            the two do
            <br />
            not overlap completely in that not all changes of context would be
            considered
            <br />
            an interruption. For example, providing a link that causes a movie
            to be opened

            <br />
            in a media player rather than in the current user agent would not be
            an
            <br />
            interruption, but would be a change of context.
            <br />

            <br />
            Regarding G75 and G76, providing a mechanism that postpones or
            allows users to
            <br />
            configure the frequency of automatic updates (G75) is different than
            providing
            <br />
            a mechanism that allows users to manually request them (G76). You
            are correct
            <br />
            however, that G76 should have been listed under 2.2.4 and we have
            corrected
            <br />

            that error.

            I beg to differ with the WG on this issue.

            <br />

            <br />
            A link that opens up a presentation in a media player does cause a
            change in
            <br />
            context but is a user initiated request (like the ones I stated in
            my email).
            <br />
            Such links or UI elements will require advisory text like "launches
            in new
            <br />
            window in media player" or the like. This link for instance cannot
            be turned
            <br />
            off as required by the "or" clause of 3.2.5 because the content
            requires a
            <br />
            player to display it. As the SC suggests, should the link be
            disabled or hidden
            <br />
            if the user prefers not to view content in a media player? Perhaps
            the content
            <br />

            and the player are fully accessible and no alternative rendering is
            available.
            <br />

            <br />
            User initiated change in context cannot cause an interruption
            because the user
            <br />
            expects something to happen by activating an UI element. And
            advisory text
            <br />
            would be a sufficient technique for this.
            <br />

            <br />
            Auto updating / refreshing content that is not user initiated is
            primarily an
            <br />
            interruption which may also cause a change in context. Like a pop-up
            or the
            <br />
            start of a Flash presentation suddenly.

            <br />
            (The techniques doc too refers to change in context caused by auto
            updating
            <br />
            content while discussing G76).
            <br />

            <br />
            I would find 3.2.5 acceptable if it read:
            <br />
            "Changes of context are initiated only by user request."
            <br />
            Causing a change in context without prior notification when a UI
            element is
            <br />
            activated by user is a failure of 3.2.5.
            <br />

            <br />

            I still think that G75 and G76 are no different.
            <br />

            <br />
            -----------------------
            <br />

            <br />
            The working group believes these are different. An interruption
            usually means that the user is returned to their original position
            after the interruption ends. A change of context generally would
            not. So 2.2.4 wouldn’t necessarily cover 3.2.5. And 3.2.5 doesn’t
            cover 2.2.4 because interruptions can take the form of a dialog box
            or other event that doesn’t necessarily change the context.
            <br />

            <br />
            We do agree that these are very similar - and a single success
            criterion might be constructed that would cover both. But it is too
            late in the process now to do this. And it would not change the
            substance of the guidelines.
            <br />

            non-text content be identified, would not be sufficient for
            Situation A of SC 1.1.1, where it is possible to provide a text
            equivalent to the non-text content.
            <br />

            When the "How to Meet SC X.Y.Z" link is selected from the WCAG 2.0
            document, the full "How to Meet WCAG 2.0" document is loaded every
            time. When the connection is slow, it takes quite a while to load
            and the page jumps around until the browser can render the correct
            scrolling position within the display. One also ends up with more
            information than one had requested, which was just to learn more
            about implementing a specific Success Criterion.<br />
            <br />
            Note: the "Understanding SC X.Y.Z" link takes users to a dedicated
            standalone page which has a clear and easy to use navigation, as
            well as more efficient orientation cues.<br />
            <br />
            Proposed Change:<br />
            1. Provide a multipage view on the "How to Meet WCAG 2.0" document
            as the default presentation, as it is often easier to use. "How to
            Meet SC X.Y.Z" links in the WCAG 2.0 document should take users to
            the specific pages of the multipage resource.<br />
            <br />
            2. Provide an option in the customizable interface to select a
            single page view for those who want a full listing (for example to
            print out a checklist of requirements to cover).<br />

            <br />
            Note: the "Understanding WCAG 2.0" document also has an option to
            display it as a single file.

            Interesting suggestion. However, the working group feels that the
            single-page view of the How to Meet document is one of its primary
            use cases in that it allows authors to view all of the techniques
            for WCAG 2.0 on a single page. If an author is interested only in a
            specific success criterion, they can use the "Understanding SC
            X.Y.Z" document, which includes the short list of sufficient and
            advisory techniques and common failures for a given success
            criterion.
            <br />

            <br />
            At this time, we have decided not to make the changes you have
            suggested, but we will keep them in mind should time and resources
            become available to explore this further.

            My developers in Germany recently went through the 3.2.2

            set of radio buttons to select the type of calendar entry to create.
            The calendar entry type can be meeting, appointment or reminder. If
            the user selects the radio for meeting, additional fields are
            displayed on the page for entering the meeting participants.
            Different fields appear if the reminder button is chosen. Because
            only parts of the entry change and the overall structure remains the
            same the basic context remains for the user. Instructions at the
            beginning of the Web page explain the behavior of each radio button
            and the fields that appear when the button is selected.”<br />
            <br />
            Pay attention to the last two sentences. It say the example is NOT a
            change of context on the second last sentence. Then we go on to say
            that instruction is needed on the next sentence. That is a
            contradiction. If the scenario is not a change of context, which I
            agree, then no instruction is needed according to the success
            criteria. If we intend to show an example to which instruction is
            needed, then we need a real change of context, not a minor change of
            content.<br />
            <br />
            The second example with tab strip seems to say that a change of
            content due to switching from tab to tab is not considered a change
            of context because it is an expected behavior. Although I agree, it
            does not seem to the appropriate decision criteria since “expected
            behavior” is not part of the change of context definition. We ought
            to tighten up either the example language or the definition.
            Obviously, that would stress test our agreement as to what degree of
            change of content constitutes a change of context. Oh that can of
            worm!<br />

            <br />
            The intent section ends with, “Changes of context are appropriate
            only when it is clear that such a change will happen when a field is
            selected or a button is pressed.” Maybe it is because my audience
            are Germans, but they are confused as to whether “only when it is
            clear that such a change will happen” applies to “a button is
            pressed”. I told them it does not, but they were really confused
            over it. Considering that many of our audience may not be fluent in
            English, we may want to simplify that.

            I was looking at WCAG 2.0 forms techniques to see what might apply
            to older users - went to two different techniques places and found
            different suggestions in the examples:<br />
            <br />
            <a
              href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20080430/G14.html"
              >http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20080430/G14.html</a
            ><br />
            <br />
            Example 4 recommends an "*" for required fields<br />
            <br />
            <a
              href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20080430/G122.html"
              >http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20080430/G122.html</a
            ><br />

            <br />
            Example 1 illustrates the better practice of using words (albeit an
            abbreviation) and recommends "(req)" for required fields<br />
            <br />
            The literature is reporting that older users often have difficulty
            with the "*" solution (as do/did WindowsEyes users and also others
            with low-vision). Also, better than "(req)" is "(required)" for
            required fields - no one should be confused then.<br />
            <br />
            Proposed Change:<br />
            Both examples should preferably use "(required)", in addition to
            colour, to indicate mandatory fields.

            We have revised technique G122 as you proposed.
            <br />

            <br />
            The working group felt it was important to include an example that
            includes the use of asterisk because we feel that it is sufficient
            to meet the success criterion and its use is commonly understood on
            the Web today. However, we added a new sufficient technique and a
            note to the example in G14 to highlight ways to reduce the
            accessibility challenges caused by the asterisk.
            <br />

            <br />
            We have added the following note to the example in G14 related to
            asterisks:
            <br />

            <br />
            Note: Asterisks may not be read by all screen readers (in all
            reading modes) and may be difficult for users with low vision
            because they are rendered in a smaller size than default text. It is
            important for authors to include the text indicating that asterisk
            is used and to consider increasing the size of the asterisk that is
            presented.
            <br />

            <br />
            We have also added a new sufficient technique to SC 3.3.2, "H90:
            Indicating required form controls", where we discuss using a larger
            font size for asterisks and alerting the user to its use at the
            start of the form.

            This comment is about Guideline 1.1 Text Alternatives, and this
            comment is about the substance of the guideline.<br />
            <br />
            The HTML5 draft[1] gives advice and examples for including text
            alternatives for a variety of image uses cases. As far as I can
            tell, the following use cases aren't addressed by WCAG 2.0:<br />
            <br />
            * A diagram illustrates what is already said textually. (HTML5 says
            alt="" for this case.)<br />
            <br />
            * A user-uploaded image whose content is unknown to the programmer
            of the HTML generator that frames the image for Web display and the
            user hasn't supplied a text alternative. (HTML5 says to put the
            description of what kind of image the image is in curly braces in
            the alt attribute. E.g. a photo sharing site would use
            alt="{photo}".)<br />

            <br />
            Proposed change:<br />
            I propose aligning with the HTML5 draft by saying that an image be
            marked as omissible from non-visual rendering if it illustrates what
            the surrounding prose already says.<br />
            <br />
            I propose aligning with the HTML5 draft by saying that if the
            generator of markup does not have a text alternative available, it
            should use the natural-language expression describing the kind of
            content (to the precision known to the generator) as the text
            alternative and use a mechanism provided by the host format for
            marking the text as not really being a text alternative but an
            indication of what kind of non-text content is in question.<br />

            We try to make our guidelines match technical standards to the
            extent possible.
            <br />

            <br />
            We have looked at the HTML 5 standard and we note that although many
            of the examples match the WCAG 2.0 guidelines - some do not,
            including the ones you mentioned. (although the second example you
            mention seems to have been removed from the September editors draft)
            <br />

            <br />
            We are adding one sufficient technique to make it clear that some of
            the examples in HTML 5 do conform with WCAG. The new technique is:
            <br />

            <br />
            G196: Using a text alternative on one item within a group of images
            that describes all items in the group (<a
              href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-TECHS/G196.html"

            >)
            <br />

            <br />
            As for the other one you cite above, we think that WCAG currently
            draws the line in the right place and changing the standard would
            create problems for accessibility.

            This comment applies to the whole set of WCAG 2.0 documents as is an
            editorial comment.<br />
            <br />
            I tried to compare alt advice in the HTML5 draft with WCAG 2.0. I
            found that matching a concrete image use case to suggested HTML
            syntax is harder when reading WCAG 2.0 than when reading HTML5.<br />
            <br />
            Splitting the content of WCAG 2.0 across three documents and trying
            to operate on a technology-agnostic abstraction level makes it WCAG
            2.0 less approachable than a document that covers concrete cases
            using a specific markup language as the example.<br />
            <br />
            Proposed solution: Making the Understanding document the spec and
            introducing things by concrete example cases instead of abstract
            terms.

            One of the requirements of WCAG (<a

              >http://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2-req/</a
            >) is to ensure that requirements may be applied across technologies
            and to ensure that the revision is "backwards and forward
            compatible". We agree that this makes the language of the guidelines
            more abstract and we have provided the Understanding and Techniques
            documents to help authors better understand how to apply the
            guidelines when using different technologies.

            <br />

            <br />
            Note that because the Understanding and Techniques documents are not
            normative, it possible for the working group to add to and revise
            them without going back through the W3C Recommendation process. This
            will, for example, make it possible for us to include HTML5
            techniques when it becomes a recommendation.

              >http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/</a
            >) already addresses part of this concern as it can be configured to
            show only the techniques in the technologies of interest.
            <br />

            <br />
            We hope that once WCAG 2.0 has become a Recommendation and is
            stable, additional document and resources will be created that will
            make it easier for authors who are only interested in specific
            technologies.

            There are both "accessibility supported" and
            "accessibility-supported" in WCAG 2.0 CR. Are they intentional or

            <br />
            For Japanese, it can be translated in several ways. We need to make
            sure what it indicates. Could you provide us with the visual

            We couldn't understand both "line spacing" and "leading". Could you
            explain both by using visual examples? There are multiple
            interpretation in Japan and both are confusing. For "line spacing" /
            "leading", We guess there would be differences among languages.<br />

            In Note 3, it reads "Content that is updated from a process,

            real-time or remote stream". Is this mean "process, realtime stream
            or remote stream"? Also we couldn't understand what "process" is in

            some are linked and the others are not linked. Is this an editorial

            RESPONSE: They are both correct. In English if you have two words
            that modify a third, the two words should be hyphenated. Thus
            ‘accessibility-supported technology’ should be hyphenated but ‘the
            technology is accessibility supported’ would not.

            successfully. “Prompting a response” refers to a use of color that
            would indicate that the user should do something. For example, a Web

            RESPONSE: It is defined because there are many definitions for
            mechanism and we are using it in a restricted (but not unusual) way.

            <br />
            What is "glyph"?
            <br />

            <br />
            For Japanese, it can be translated in several ways. We need to make
            sure what it indicates. Could you provide us with the visual
            examples (not in text)? It will allow us to find an appropriate word
            in Japanese.
            <br />

            <br />
            RESPONSE: The characters in hiragana and katakana are glyphs. Kanji
            are also glyphs. As are the representations of characters in the
            Western Alphabet See

            <br />
            What is "line spacing" / "leading"?
            <br />

            <br />
            We couldn't understand both "line spacing" and "leading". Could you
            explain both by using visual examples? There are multiple
            interpretation in Japan and both are confusing. For "line spacing" /
            "leading", We guess there would be differences among languages.
            <br />

            <br />
            Proposed Change:
            <br />

            <br />

            Need visual explanation on what "line spacing" is and what "leading"
            is. We'll be able to translate them if we see both.
            <br />

            <br />
            RESPONSE: “Line spacing” is the space from the top of one line to
            the top of the next line. It is also called “Leading” for historical
            reasons. It comes from the old days when type was set by hand. Thin
            sheets of lead (the metal) were inserted between lines to adjust
            their spacing. So we now call any extra space between lines
            “leading”.
            <br />

            <br />
            What is "space-and-a-half"?
            <br />

            <br />
            We need more details on "space-and-a-half". It is one of the jargon.
            We couldn't find an appropriate word in Japanese.

            <br />

            <br />
            Proposed Change:
            <br />

            <br />
            Need explanation.
            <br />

            <br />
            RESPONSE: There is not a word for this in English either. We must
            use a phrase. Space-and-a-half means that there is 50% more distance
            from the top of one line and the top of the next line than is normal
            for that font. (50% more than ‘single-spaced’ text)
            <br />

            <br />
            We have added an illustration of this to the understanding document
            (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/62jzfl">http://tinyurl.com/62jzfl</a>).

            <br />
            What "path" means
            <br />

            <br />
            We need the clarification what "path" means. Is it applied to
            pointing device only? Or also keyboard interfaces? Or any other
            movement?
            <br />

            <br />
            Proposed Change:
            <br />

            <br />
            "path" can be translated to wider range of meaning. Need
            clarification.
            <br />

            <br />
            RESPONSE: PATH means the “path taken by the users movement”. With
            pointing devices, the path you take to a button does not change the
            result if you press the button. However, if you are drawing a
            freehand line, you get a much different shape depending on the path
            of your movement. Same for a watercolor painting on your computer.
            <br />

            <br />
            "timing" = "time limit"?
            <br />

            <br />
            The "Note" reads "While exceptions to Success Criterion 2.2.1 where
            timing is essential exist,". Does "timing" mean "time limit"?
            <br />

            <br />
            Proposed Change:
            <br />

            <br />
            Need explanation.
            <br />

            <br />
            RESPONSE: YES. We have revised the note to read as follows.
            <br />

            <br />

            DONE Note: This success criterion helps ensure that users can
            complete tasks without unexpected changes in content or context that
            are a result of a time limit. This success criterion should be
            considered in conjunction with Success Criterion 3.2.1 which puts
            limits on changes of content or context as a result of user action.
            <br />

            <br />
            -------------------------
            <br />

            <br />
            more than 5 seconds
            <br />
            Does it mean that "5.0 seconds" is not included and "5.01 seconds"
            is included?
            <br />

            <br />
            Proposed Change:
            <br />

            <br />
            Just to confirm.
            <br />

            <br />
            RESPONSE: YES. "more than 5 sec" = "&gt; 5 sec". One would prefer
            more than 1/100th of a second but that would indeed satisfy the
            requirement.
            <br />

            <br />
            -------------------------
            <br />

            <br />
            What "process" means
            <br />

            <br />
            In Note 3, it reads "Content that is updated from a process,
            real-time or remote stream". We couldn't understand "a process,
            real-time or remote stream". Is this mean "process, real time stream
            or remote stream"? Also we couldn't understand what "process" is in
            this Note 3.
            <br />

            <br />
            Proposed Change:
            <br />

            <br />
            Very hard to translate. Could you say this in other words?
            <br />

            <br />
            RESPONSE: We have revised the note as follows:
            <br />
            "Content that is automatically updated periodically by software, or
            that is streamed to the user agent…” [is not required to preserve or
            present information that is generated or received between the
            initiation of the pause and resuming presentation, as this may not
            be technically possible, and in many situations could be misleading
            to do so.]

            <br />

            <br />
            Is this easier to understand?
            <br />

            <br />
            -------------------------
            <br />
            Why "bypass"?
            <br />

            <br />
            We use "skip" for this. We'd like to know why you use "bypass"
            instead of "skip". What is the difference??
            <br />

            <br />

            Proposed Change:
            <br />

            <br />
            Need explanation for appropriate translation.
            <br />

            <br />
            RESPONSE: Bypass and Skip mean the same thing. You could use either
            word in this provision. In English skip has multiple meanings so
            Bypass was used in our document. It means to “pass by without
            stopping”.
            <br />

            <br />
            -------------------------
            <br />
            "sections" = "section" in Glossary?
            <br />

            <br />
            In Note 2, it reads "This success criterion covers sections within
            writing,". We couldn't understand what "sections within writing"
            means. Does "sections within writing" mean the same thing as
            "section" in Glossary?
            <br />

            <br />
            Need clarification.
            <br />

            <br />
            RESPONSE: YES. Sections is the plural of ‘section’ and we mean it as
            defined in the Glossary.
            <br />

            <br />
            -------------------------
            <br />

            <br />

            "report progress" for whom?
            <br />

            <br />
            In Note 1, it reads "Although conformance can only be achieved at
            the stated levels, authors are encouraged to satisfy and report
            progress toward meeting success criteria from all levels beyond the
            achieved level of conformance." What did you want to say by "report
            progress"?
            <br />

            <br />
            Proposed Change:
            <br />

            <br />
            Hard to translation. Need clarification.
            <br />

            <br />

            RESPONSE: We mean "include in the conformance claim." We should make
            this clearer. We will change this to "authors are encouraged to
            report (in their claim) any progress toward…"
            <br />

            <br />
            -------------------------
            <br />

            <br />
            why "consumers"?
            <br />

            <br />
            In "Optional components of a conformance claim" section, it reads
            "This information should be provided in a form that consumers can
            use, preferably machine-readable metadata." Who is "consumers"? Does
            it mean "end users of the web site/web application"? If so, why
            "consumers" instead of "users"?
            <br />

            <br />
            Need explanation.

            <br />

            <br />
            RESPONSE: Good catch. We should be consistent. We only user
            ‘consumers’ in the one location in the document. We will change it
            to ‘This information should be provided to users in a usable form,
            preferably machine-readable metadata’ in the next draft.
            <br />

            -------------------------
            <br />

            <br />
            words in Glossary
            <br />

            <br />
            We found that several words don't have links to the same words in
            Glossary though they are defined in Glossary. For the same word,
            some are linked and the others are not linked. Is this an editorial
            mistakes? Or the words which don't link to Glossary are used in
            different meaning?
            <br />

            <br />
            Proposed Change:
            <br />

            <br />
            Add link to Glossary to all if they are editorial mistakes.
            <br />

            <br />
            RESPONSE: We provide links from terms as they are used normatively
            in SC and some other places. We don't duplicate a link in the SC or
            paragraph/section. We only make it a link the first time it appears.

            There are no exclusions for complex non-text content such as
            geospatial maps. However, if your example is typical, the "Recent
            Earthquakes" link provides a long description of the information
            provided by the map. In addition, your example provides an alternate
            version of the data used to generate the map via the search feature.
            The map could contain a short description that indicates what kind
            of data it contains and tells the user where to find the longer
            description. See Situation B in Understanding Success Criterion
            1.1.1 for similar techniques.

            In the section of "Incidental", it reads "..., have no minimum
            contrast requirement". It should be "enhanced" instead of "minimum"
            as this is the SC for "Contrast (Enhanced)".<br />

            <br />
            Proposed Change:<br />
            Change "..., have no minimum contrast requirement" to "..., have no
            enhanced contrast requirement".
          </td>
          <td width="50%" class="detail">
            "Minimum" is correct in these parts of SC 1.4.6. Just as with SC
            1.4.3, there is no minimum contrast requirement for text that occurs
            in the situations described by the Incidental and Logotypes clauses.
            So that text may have very poor contrast and still satisfy the
            success criterion.
            <br />

            <br />
            We have revised the second bullet of 1.4.3 and 1.4.6 as follows to
            clarify this:
            <br />

            <br />
            Incidental: Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user
            interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible
            to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant
            other visual content, have no contrast requirement.

            alternate version located on another site that included an HTML

            for Japanese. To be testable, we have to present the font sizes like
            "18 point or 14 point bold" for Japanese authors.

            would be suitable for large print in CJK languages, we would welcome

            <br />
            NOTE 5: The 18 and 14 point sizes for roman texts are taken from the
            minimum size for large print (14pt) and the larger standard font
            size (18pt). For other fonts such as CJK languages the "equivalent"
            sizes would the the minimum large print size used for those
            languages and the next larger standard large print size.

            The differences between these terms can be somewhat confusing.
            Perhaps the following definitions (from wikipedia) will help.
            <br />

            <br />
            - a grapheme is the fundamental unit in written language. Graphemes
            include alphabetic letters, Chinese characters, numerals,
            punctuation marks, and all the individual symbols of any of the
            world's writing systems.

            <br />

            <br />
            - a character is a unit of information that roughly corresponds to a
            grapheme
            <br />

            <br />
            - a glyph is the shape given in a particular typeface to a specific
            grapheme or symbol
            <br />

            <br />
            Another useful resource that may help in understanding this topic
            is:
            <br />

            <br />
            FAQ: Character encodings for beginners:
            <br />

            >
            <br />

            <br />
            In your example, all of the items mentioned (%, $, &amp;, @, #, 33%)
            would be both characters and glyphs because the association between
            their shape and the information the shapes represent are intact. If
            however, you were to create a font where the character mapping for
            the letter "b" was associated with a glyph that was a picture of a
            fish, then you would have something that is a glyph, but not a
            character.

            General Note: Success Criterion 3.3.1 states: "If an error is
            automatically detected, the item that is in error is identified and
            the error is described to the user in text"<br />
            <br />
            The Success Criterion seems to imply that if errors are not
            automatically detected then the Success Criterion is not
            relevant.<br />
            However, the technique G83: "Providing text descriptions to identify
            required fields that were not completed" seems to state that errors
            must be detected:<br />
            <br />
            1. Fill out a form, deliberately leaving one or more required
            (mandatory) fields blank, and submit it.<br />
            2. Check that a text description is provided identifying the
            mandatory field(s) that was not completed.<br />

            <br />
            Is it a breach of this Success Criterion if errors are not
            automatically detected?<br />
            <br />
            G83 Technique also contains an example which does not work for
            screen reader users:<br />
            <br />
            "A user is completing a form that contains mandatory fields. The
            labels of the fields indicate whether or not they are mandatory. The
            user tabs to a mandatory field, and tabs out of the field without
            entering any data or selecting a choice. A client-side script
            modifies the label of the field to indicate that leaving it blank
            was an error".<br />
            <br />
            Many screen readers would not pick up the change in the DOM which is
            done by the scripting. Even if the screen readers copy of the page
            is updated when the label is updated (reflecting the change in the
            DOM), the user might not tab back to that control to have the label
            announced.<br />
            <br />
            The two other examples mentioned in the technique works very well
            for screen reader users. So including the above example in the
            technique could potentially mean that it is implemented instead of a
            technique that works for screen reader users.
          </td>
          <td width="50%" class="detail">
            If errors are not automatically detected, SC 3.3.1 is not relevant.
            The success criterion ensures that when errors are reported they are
            reported in a way that makes it easier for users to understand what
            field was in error and why.
            <br />

            <br />
            If the error is not automatically detected then none of the users
            are notified of the error and people with disabilities are at no
            special disadvantage.
            <br />

            <br />
            We have added an explanation to the third example in G83 that screen
            reader users may not be aware of the error:
            <br />

            <br />
            Note: Some screen readers may not notice and announce the change to
            the label so screen reader users may be unaware of the error.

            General Note:<br />

            The two techniques for Success Criterion 3.2.4 - Consistent
            Identification do not seem related to the success criterion.<br />
            <br />
            The two techniques are:<br />
            <br />
            H44: Using label elements to associate text labels with form
            controls (HTML)<br />
            H65: Using the title attribute to identify form controls when the
            label element cannot be used<br />
            <br />
            These techniques deal purely with correct labeling on individual
            pages while the success criterion is about consistent labeling
            across many pages.<br />
            <br />
            The techniques seem to imply, for example, that if a search function
            at the top of all pages have different label text on different
            pages, it still passes if the labels are correctly marked-up
            (associated) on the individual pages. This goes against the Success
            Criterion.

            We have revised the sufficient techniques section of Understanding

            Technique: "H33: Supplementing link text with the title attribute"
            creates accessibility issues: it encourages the use of an attribute
            that is not widely announced by screen readers and never will be.<br />

            <br />
            Screen reader users have more than enough information to process
            when listening to a page, and expecting them to listen to the title
            of links just in case the title includes extra information is
            unreasonable.<br />
            <br />
            Why includes this technique when there are perfectly good
            alternatives, for example including information in the link text or
            off-screen?.

            The User Agent and Assistive Technology Notes for H33 are extensive,

            can pose for users. This technique is only sufficient when the title
            is providing supplemental information to the link text.

            Because of the extensive user agent limitations in supporting access
            to the title attribute, authors should use caution in applying this
            technique. For this reason, it is preferred that the author use

            <br />
            I suggest to stay with ISO standard 3:1 for 1.4.3 and 5:1 for 1.4.6

          </td>

            The ISO standard is for people with normal vision. These guidelines
            are designed to provide enough contrast to accommodate people with
            low vision including those with colorblindness.
            <br />

            <br />
            We could use 5:1 and 7:1 without a lesser value for larger print but
            this is more restrictive than necessary. However, if an author
            desires to make it simpler for themselves they could just use 5:1
            and 7:1 and avoid considering font size.
            <br />

            <br />

            Note that based on implementation feedback, we have changed the
            ratio for SC 1.4.3 from 5:1 to 4.5:1. For people with vision
            impairments, 4.5:1 is equivalent to ISO's 3:1 for people with normal
            vision.

            WCAG 2.0 contains progressive requirements for some types of
            content, that is, the requirements at Level AA are more rigorous
            than the requirements at Level A and similarly for Level AAA and
            Level AA.
            <br />

            <br />
            So SC 1.2.3 at Level A requires either Audio Descriptions or Full
            Text Alternatives. At Level AA, SC 1.2.5 requires Audio Descriptions
            and Level AAA SC 1.2.8 requires Full Text Alternatives. To conform
            at Level AAA, both Audio Descriptions (possibly Extended) and Full
            Text Alternatives are required.
            <br />

            <br />
            However, at Level AA, it is possible to conform with only Audio
            Descriptions provided and at Level A, it is possible to conform with
            only Full Text Alternatives.
            <br />

            <br />
            SC 1.4.5 (Images of Text), at Level AA, is very similar to SC 1.4.9
            (Images of Text (No Exception) at Level AAA except a Level AA an
            exception is permitted if the technology used cannot achieve the
            visual presentation of the text. At Level AAA, this exception is
            removed.
            <br />

            <br />
            When content satisfies SC 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) at Level A
            the user may need to consults programmatically determined link
            context to determine the purpose of the link. At Level AAA, SC 2.4.9
            (Link Purpose (Link Only)) requires that the link context depend
            only on the link text itself not on the context.
            <br />

            <br />
            With respect the headings, SC 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships)
            requires that if headings are used they are marked up in a way that
            assistive technology can recognize them as headings. But it does not
            require that headings be used. SC 2.4.10 (Section Headings) requires
            that headings be present.

            The provision has "that are part of a picture that contains

            I have a question/comment about F78: Failure of Success Criterion
            2.4.7 due to styling element outlines and borders in a way that
            overrides or renders non-visible the default visual focus indicator.
            The failure as it is written seems to mean that the browser default
            focus cannot be overwritten or turned off. Does assistive technology
            use the browsers default focus indicator to indicate focus to a
            user?<br />

            If so, then I understand that it probably shouldn't be turned off
            entirely, but I'm having trouble understanding why the default focus
            indicator can't be rendered non-visible, as long as it is replaced
            by something more visible.<br />
            <br />
            In my opinion, in most browsers, including both IE 7 and Firefox 2,
            the default focus indicator is so hard to see that overriding it
            almost seems necessary in order to make the focus indicator really
            visible. It is especially hard to see when a form element, such as a
            checkbox, has focus.<br />
            <br />
            This Failure also seems to be in contradiction with 2.4.7 Any
            keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the
            keyboard focus indicator is visible. (Level AA). Reading 2.4.7, it
            seems that is OK to override the default focus border as long as
            focus IS visible. We also allow an "author supplied, highly visible
            focus indicator" and C15 allows the use of CSS to change the
            presentation of a UI component when it receives focus. For example,
            changing the background color of a focused menu item still makes
            focus visible even if there is no dotted border.<br />
            <br />
            Does F78 mean that all of the sufficient techniques in 2.4.7 will
            fail? Perhaps F78 should just say that shouldn't entirely disable
            the focus indicator?

            Thanks for catching this. We agree that the failure was written too
            narrowly. We have updated it so that the failure only occurs if
            there is no visible focus indicator.

            &gt; There are many instances where important visual information<br />

            # I respectfully disagree. The note under "extended audio
            description" in<br />
            the WCAG 2.0 Glossary says "This technique is only used when the
            sense of<br />

            the video would be lost without the additional audio description and
            the<br />
            pauses between dialog/narration are too short." The subjective
            judgement<br />
            here is whether the "sense of the video would be lost". Audio
            description on<br />
            all of our videos was provided by highly credible audio description
            vendors<br />
            (WGBH, Narrative TV, and Vitac), and we had an opportunity to review
            their<br />
            audio description scripts prior to recording to ensure that users
            would<br />
            indeed have full access to the "sense" of the video. Since both the
            vendor<br />
            and DO-IT have signed off on the audio description content for each
            video, I<br />
            believe that we have met this success criterion.<br />

            <br />
            If you stand by your disagreement, I would be interested in knowing
            specific<br />
            details about where you feel our audio description is inadequate.
            This would<br />
            be important feedback for our vendors, since their failure to meet
            the<br />
            success criteria will impact large numbers of their clients' videos
            as well.

          <td width="50%" class="detail">
            We have revised Success Criterion 1.2.7 as follows:
            <br />

            <br />
            1.2.7 Audio Description (Extended): Where pauses in foreground audio
            are insufficient to allow audio descriptions to convey the sense of
            the video, extended audio description is provided for all
            prerecorded video content in synchronized media. (Level AAA)
            <br />

            <br />
            Quality of text alternatives is subjective, so we do not specify the
            quality of text alternatives, captions or descriptions. As long as
            the alternatives are not mere placeholders, the Success Criterion
            would be met.

            <br />

            <br />
            Therefore, these examples would meet the success criterion, though
            we would prefer that additional information such as speaker
            identification and other important information that had been
            provided in text visually be included.

            This success critereon raises many questions, and currently there is
            too<br />
            little support provided in WCAG 2.0 for us to know exactly how to
            proceed.<br />
            We can add a sign language interpreter to our videos via SMIL but as
            far as<br />
            we could find there's little or no research or precedent for
            optimum<br />
            positioning and size of the interpreter, relative to the main video.
            The<br />
            "Related Resources" section under "Understanding SC 1.2.6" includes
            a link<br />

            to "NCAM Rich Media Accessibility, Accessible SMIL Templates", but
            none of<br />
            the templates on this page include a region for sign language.<br />
            <br />
            Also, this success critereon says nothing about which language is
            most<br />
            appropriate. If we use American Sign Language (ASL), we're still<br />
            inaccessible to users who only know Signed English or British Sign
            Language.<br />

            as an example. Although the primary language of this site is
            English, none<br />
            of my American deaf colleagues could understand the sign language<br />

            interpreter. I'm guessing it's British Sign Language? Is this really
            an<br />
            issue of internationalization, rather than accessibility?

            <br />
            That sign language and oral language do not map 1-to-1 is an
            unfortunate complication. In this circumstance, using any of the
            sign languages that correspond to the oral language will satisfy the
            success criterion. It does not require providing all of them. It is
            recommended, of course, to use the sign language of the target
            culture or country.

            As noted in my comments related to 1.2.7, all our audio
            description<br />
            was produced by one of three highly credible vendors. The lack of<br />
            conformance here raises a couple of important questions for me:<br />
            <br />
            First, if audio description is mixed into the program audio, how can
            the<br />
            difference between audio description foreground and background be
            measured?<br />
            That would seem to require very high end audio tools, if it's even
            possible.<br />

            Measuring the difference by determining whether the foreground is<br />
            "approximately four times louder" is still extremely subjective, and
            I doubt<br />
            that many people have audio perception that is accute enough to
            reliably<br />
            measure that.<br />
            <br />
            Second, assuming our foreground/background really does differ by
            less than<br />
            20dB, our failure to conform suggests that much of the audio
            description<br />
            produced by these same leading vendors probably does not meet this
            success<br />
            criterion. How was 20db determined as a threshhold? Might it be to
            strict?

            <br />

            <br />
            - The RMS volume can be measured in the gaps before or after or in
            pauses during the description and compared to the RMS volume of the
            description.

            - We acknowledge that it can be difficult to evaluate foreground and

            much easier to evaluate this requirement.

            The understanding document (intent section) cites two sources and
            memebers of our working group have confirmed these findings with
            various experts in the field.

            occasional
            <br />
            word, it is acceptable to have occasional dips of contrast between
            10dbs-20

            dbs for up to 2 words in a sentence that are isolated and not nouns

            The Techniques for 1.4.8 (Fourth Requirement) include examples for
            setting<br />

            line spacing to space-and-a-half within paragraphs (e.g., p {
            line-height:<br />
            150%; } ). However, this would seem to address only the first
            portion of<br />
            this requirement. How does one also ensure that "paragraph spacing
            is at<br />
            least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing?"<br />
            <br />
            My confusion comes partially from the use of line-height in the
            first<br />
            example. Is line-height synonymous with "line spacing"? My brain
            views this<br />
            requirement in two ways. Is either of these accurate?<br />
            <br />
            a) If I have font-size:1em, and line-height:1.5em, I believe that
            line<br />

            spacing is the amount of space not occupied by text (0.5em), in
            which case<br />
            the paragraph should have margin-bottom:1.5em (line spacing x
            1.5).<br />
            <br />
            b) "Line spacing" actually refers to line-height. So if I have<br />
            line-height:1.5em, then my paragraph should have 1.5x that for a
            bottom<br />
            margin (or padding), e.g., margin-bottom:2.25em.<br />
            <br />
            Since I have to ask the above question, I think more explanation,
            including<br />
            additional examples, should be included in the Techniques for this
            success<br />
            criterion.

            Your first proposal (a) is the correct one.

            <br />

            <br />
            You are also correct that there should be more information in the
            Understanding doc.
            <br />

            <br />
            Additional information has been added therefore to the Understanding
            document. Paragraph 4 now reads
            <br />

            <br />
            People with some cognitive disabilities find it difficult to track
            text where the lines are close together. Providing extra space
            between lines and paragraphs allows them to better track the next
            line and to recognize when they have reached the end of a paragraph.
            It is best if there are several different options, for instance,
            space-and-a-half and double spacing for line spacing. By space and a
            half within paragraphs we mean that top of one line is 150% further
            from the top of the line below it than would be true when the text
            is 'single spaced' (the default spacing for the font). By Paragraph
            spacing that is 1.5 times larger than the line spacing we mean that
            the spacing from the top of the last line of 1 paragraph is 250%
            farther from the Top of the first line of the next paragraph (I.e.
            that there is a blank line between the two paragraphs that is 150%
            of the single space blank line).

            The primary content of our site is that contained within the videos,
            and as<br />
            the ratings on the transcript pages indicate, this content meets the
            success<br />
            criterion.<br />

            <br />
            Between now and October 13, I will edit the FAQ page with
            improved<br />
            readability in mind, and hopefully can attain a more readable FAQ
            without<br />
            creating a separate version.<br />
            <br />
            The home page is trickier. The ratings on this page are higher
            because it is<br />
            comprised almost exclusively of video titles and their official<br />
            descriptions, and these titles and descriptions include words with
            more<br />
            syllables, such as "disabilities", "postsecondary education", and<br />
            "accessible". Even if we could think of suitable alternative words
            to use in<br />

            our descriptions, I think we would still have Gunning Fog Indexes
            and<br />
            Flesch-Kincaid Grades higher than 9 because of the titles, and we
            can't<br />
            change this content.<br />
            <br />
            Given that our transcripts (and therefore our video content) already
            meets<br />
            this success criterion, and if we address the readability of the
            FAQ, would<br />
            that be sufficient for claiming that our site meets AAA conformance
            to this<br />
            success criterion?
          </td>
          <td width="50%" class="detail">
            We have discovered that the length of proper names, titles and other
            things that cannot be changed can affect the reading level scores
            such that it is not possible to meet the reading levels. For
            example, America or Argentina or Pellegrino push the indexes up but
            there is no way to make them shorter or simpler and over-use of "it"
            or "them" can make sentences ambiguous rather than simpler.
            <br />

            <br />
            We are therefore changing the SC to require that the text meet the
            reading levels AFTER removal of proper names and titles (which would
            include book titles).

            <br />
            This is passive in that the information and relationships must be
            explicitly represented in the data. Whether user agents and
            assistive technology actively use this information is a question of
            accessibility support for the technology.

            both<br />

            even like this, there will still be place for interpretations ; I

            We understand that there are different interpretations of what is
            decorative. The definition of 'decorative' in WCAG says that you
            would need to be able to replace the picture with another picture of
            something else - and that would clearly be a problem on this page.

            We've confirmed that every figures you mentioned above are assistive
            contents for better understanding, and every vital information are
            described in the text. We mean, for example, "exact organization
            structure" is not vital in the context. So we believe that we don't
            have to do anything to meet 1.1.1 about these figures/contents.

            (Level AAA) How to Meet 1.4.7 Understanding 1.4.7
            <br />

            <br />
            * No Background: The audio does not contain background sounds.
            <br />
            * Turn Off: The background sounds can be turned off.
            <br />
            * 20 dB: The background sounds are at least 20 decibels lower than
            the foreground speech content, with the exception of occasional
            sounds that last for only one or two seconds.

            The main page for the video contains links to pages that provide

            of meeting the corresponding success criterion, it is not clear that
            this structure satisfies the Conforming Alternate Version
            definition, since no one version meets all of the success criteria.
            Nevertheless, this seems like a useful way to organize the many
            different copies of the videos (since there are also multiple

            qualify as a Full Text Equivalent?

            The Transcript is posted to the body of the page. The page as a
            whole therefore needs to be taken into account. The question is
            whether the 'content' or 'intent' or 'purpose' of the video is
            presented in the transcript. The warnings at the beginning and end
            are not part of the purpose or function of the video - but these are
            actually contained on the page anyway.
            <br />

            <br />
            Note that we have replaced the term "full text alternative for
            synchronized media including any interaction" with "alternative for
            time-based media." and have adjusted the definition as follows:
            <br />

            <br />
            alternative for time-based media
            <br />

            document including correctly sequenced text descriptions of

            <br />

            <br />

            <br />
            Since the bulk of what is intended to be presented though (the
            apology itself) is presented on the page, in the text box, and in
            the other text on the page, we feel that this example passes the
            requirement. However, there are other visual things that could be
            added to the description to make it better. A short description of
            the context would be a good addition.

            opened, focus is trapped within the dialog; tabbing from the last
            control in the dialog takes focus to the first control in the
            dialog. The dialog is dismissed by activating the Cancel button or
            the OK button.

            It was brought to my attention that a category of containers in
            which they are designed to fit limited amount of text may be
            incompatible with guideline 1.4.4. A note may be needed to
            facilitate its use.<br />

            <br />
            We see these sorts of containers nearly every day when doing tab
            browsing and using the windows taskbar. Note how the tabs in tab
            browsing handle titles—the tabs truncate long titles. The tab itself
            is not meant to increase in size to accommodate the text. As more
            tabs are added, the size the tab must eventually decrease. Windows
            taskbar behaves much the same way. Since they are not designed to
            fit long title even at normal text size, 200 percent increase in
            text size would surely truncate the text on display even more. More
            complete text is available via tooltips which can generally be
            resized without being subject to the truncation.<br />
            <br />
            Indeed, tab browsing is a user agent issue and windows taskbar is an
            operating design issue. But the same behavior can be seen in
            tables—for example subject column in Gmail. Long email subjects are
            truncated and increased font size would truncate the subject text
            even more.<br />
            <br />
            The question is—does the application of such truncation constitute a
            loss of content per 1.4.4?<br />
            <br />
            On the surface, it seems that there is clearly loss of content if
            more content is truncated due to increased text size. <br />
            <br />
            Demanding a redesign of tab seems to me a fundamental alteration of
            its very purpose. Such redesign may confuse nearly all users and may
            acutely disadvantage those with cognitive disorders. To the degree
            possible, I believe we ought to avoid forcing any change in the tab
            behavior.<br />
            <br />
            I would like to suggest that there is actually no loss of content in
            the scenario. First, the content is not lost if it is available via
            tooltip and that the tooltip can be resized. Thus, one may consider
            the tooltip alternative conformance content. Second, truncating
            content that are already truncated may not necessarily count as loss
            of content. The full content is meant to be access via either
            tooltip or and viewing the content in full (looking at the content
            within the tab). The text displayed within the container (tab) is
            merely a truncated representation of the actual content. Thus, the
            scenario is a reduction of a proxy of the actual content, not a
            reduction of content itself.<br />

            <br />
            My proposed solution is to add a note following the line of argument
            on one of the two arguments above — either<br />
            <br />
            1.treat tooltip as alternative or<br />
            <br />
            2. Treat container text as only proxy representation of actual
            content which are available elsewhere.<br />
            <br />
            I prefer to apply this proposal as a note to 1.4.4 or understanding
            doc, not a sufficient technique since it is not really a technique
            of any kind. It is a special situation in which expected behavior
            conflicts against display of content.

            Thanks. We have added the following paragraph to Understanding SC
            1.4.4 to clarify that this type of truncation is not considered
            losing functionality:
            <br />

            <br />
            Some user interface components that function as a label and require
            activation by the user to access content are not wide enough to
            accomodate the label's content. For example, in Web mail
            applications the subject column may not wide enough to accomodate
            every possible subject header, but activating the subject header
            takes the user to the full message with the full subject header. In
            Web-based spreadsheets, cell content that is too long to be
            displayed in a column can be truncated, and the full content of the
            cell is available to the user when the cell receives focus. The
            content of a user interface component may also become too wide in
            user interfaces where the user can resize the column width. In this
            type of user interface component, line wrapping is not required;
            truncation is acceptable if the component's full content is
            available on focus or after user activation and an indication that
            this information can be accessed, is provided to the user in some
            way besides the fact that it is truncated.

            When I was evaluating if an implementation met the luminosity
            contrast requirements (SC 1.4.3, SC 1.4.6), I needed to check
            whether certain spans of text were large print or not. According to
            the definition, large scale test is "at least 18 point or 14 point
            bold or font size that would yield equivalent stroke width for
            Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) fonts". In the implementation I
            evaluated, font sizes were expressed in em units. Inspection with
            Firebug gave me computed font sizes in px units. I then looked for a
            conversion from pixels to point sizes and found the conversion
            tables at

            There should be a more practical way to check whether text is large
            text. Any suggestions?

            (which puts 12 pt as 1 em) you get 14 pt as 1.2 em and 18 pt as 1.5
            em.
            <br />

            <br />
            To make this easier we have added 1.2 em and 1.5 em to note 3 of the
            definition of large text as follows:
            <br />

            <br />
            Note 3: The actual size of the character that a user sees is
            dependent both on the author-defined size and the users display or
            user-agent settings. For many mainstream body text fonts, 14 and 18
            point is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% of
            the default size for body text (assuming that the body font is
            100%), but authors would need to check this for the particular fonts
            in use. When fonts are defined in relative units, the actual point
            size is calculated by the user agent for display. The point size
            should be obtained from the user agent, or calculated based on font
            metrics as the user agent does, when evaluating this success
            criterion.Users who have low vision would be responsible for
            choosing appropriate settings.

            A statement of partial conformance is a statement of
            non-conformance. It says the the page does not conform but would if
            some part(s) of it were removed or not present. Since it is not a
            statement of conformance (but of non-conformance) there is no need
            to mention the other parts of a conformance claim since a
            conformance claim cannot be made. Also, listing all of the other
            information in a claim may be confusing and lead to the impression
            that the page did conform - or that parts of the page conform (which
            is not possible - conformance is strictly on a page basis).

            In order to avoid confusion - making a partial conformance claim
            look like a conformance claim is not suggested.

            <br />
            We have also made the following change to the description of partial

            This section [on partial conformance] also requires that the
            excluded content 'is <br />

            described in a way that that users can identify (e.g. they can't be

            <br />
            in the conforming part of the content. For example, if you pull in
            <br />
            image ads without alt text, what would you need to do?<br />
            Which of the following would be sufficient?<br />

            (b1) Conformance claim says that ads from ad server XYZ are

            are good practice, but are not required.
            <br />

            <br />
            However, given your description of the way the Statement of Partial
            Conformance has been written, the only way to conform would be to
            label each part in the content, since otherwise users would not be

            More info on how partial conformance and conformance requirement 5
            <br />
            interact would be welcomed.<br />
            For example, if you have a page that triggers a semi-transparent
            <br />
            Flash overlay (as an alternative to a pop-up prompt or a new window
            - <br />

            Flash through a statement of partial conformance, does conformance
            <br />

            requirement 5 still apply? In my opinion, the intent is that the
            <br />
            conformance requirements still apply, but that is not clear from the
            <br />
            section on partial conformance.<br />
            According to our definition of "relied upon" the content still needs
            <br />
            to conform if Flash is turned off or not supported, but I'm not sure
            <br />
            if readers understand the implications of that definition.

          <td width="50%" class="detail">
            Conformance requirement 5 applies to content under the author's
            control that is present in the page but not relied on. It does not
            apply to the excluded content from Statements of Partial
            Conformance.
            <br />

            <br />
            If the third-party Flash content were removed from the page (as is
            required for evaluation of partial conformance), the keyboard
            trapping would not occur. So a Statement of Partial Conformance
            could still be made for such a page if the Flash content is not
            under the author's control and can be identified as the
            non-conforming content.

            If there is a mechanism to pause or stop the audio or to control its
            <br />
            volume, it is allowed to play automatically and for more than 3
            <br />
            seconds. This means that a screen reader user needs to find that
            <br />
            mechanism while the audio is still playing, i.e. interfering with
            the <br />
            speech output of his/her screen reader. So even content that passes
            <br />
            this SC can interfere with the user's ability to use the whole page.

            Unfortunately, this is the case. The audio may be playing while the
            screen reader user locates and activates the mechanism to control
            it. The working group could find no way around this other than
            forbidding any audio from playing on page opening. We have added a
            note recommending against using audio on page opening (that lasts
            more than 3 seconds) as follows:

            <br />

            <br />
            Note: Playing audio automatically when landing on a page may affect
            a screen reader user's ability to find the mechanism to stop it
            because they navigate by listening and automatically started sounds
            might interfere with that navigation. Therefore, we discourage the
            practice of automatically starting sounds (especially if they last
            more than 3 seconds), and encourage that the sound be *started* by
            an action initiated by the user after they reach the page, rather
            than requiring that the sound be *stopped* by an action of the user
            after they land on the page.

            When I created a list of success criteria that apply to <br />
            synchronised media, I found the following:<br />
            SC 1.2.2 at Level A requires captions. If authors want to conform at
            <br />
            Level AA, they also need to pass SC 1.4.4 (Resize text). If captions
            <br />
            are implemented as text (closed captions), SC 1.4.4 applies to the
            <br />
            captions, since there is nothing in the SC that says that captions
            <br />

            are exempted. If video plugins don't have a resize functionality,
            <br />
            this needs to be implemented in the content. Are there any plugins
            <br />
            for video that can resize captions? If not, in which formats can
            <br />
            authors implement functionality to resize text? (SMIL??)
          </td>
          <td width="50%" class="detail">
            Good catch. We have modified SC 1.4.4 to add an exception for
            captions:
            <br />

            <br />
            Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without
            assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or
            functionality.
            <br />

            <br />
            We have also added an advisory technique to 1.4.4:
            <br />

            <br />
            Providing a mechanism to allow captions to be enlarged
