Accessibility Guidelines Working Group Charter
==============================================

The **mission** of the [Accessibility Guidelines Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/) is to develop specifications to support making implementations of web technologies accessible for people with disabilities, and to develop and maintain implementation support materials.

[Join the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group.](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/35422/join)

This proposed charter is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/blob/charter-2019/charter.html). Feel free to raise [issues](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues).

Scope
-----

The group will:

-   Develop Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 to address gaps in WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 related to content with a particular focus on users of mobile devices and people with low vision or with cognitive disabilities.
-   Continue development of a repository of test rules that uses the [Accessibility Conformance Rules Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format-1.0/), to promote a unified interpretation of WCAG 2.x among different web accessibility test tools.
-   Develop a new standard (name to be decided) to succeed WCAG 2.x based on the work of the Silver Task Force. The goal is to provide information that can be used to improve the accessibility of products when using the guidelines on a variety of platforms. As noted in the [Draft Requirements](https://w3c.github.io/silver/requirements/), it will use a different framework to allow it to address more disability needs, address publishing requirements and emerging technologies on the web such as web XR (augmented, virtual and mixed reality) and voice input. It will provide non-normative information about the ways web technologies need to work with authoring tools, user agents, and assistive technologies. This framework is intended to support better coverage across disabilities, and be easier to maintain, so that the new framework will be more durable over time as technologies evolve. This will require development of a new conformance model, engaging policy makers in that process, and testing the model with policy makers from different settings.
-   Maintain [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/) as needed.
-   Continue development of non-normative documents to support implementation of accessibility guidelines.

### Out of Scope

The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this Working group.

-   The AG WG is not required to be the central repository for accessibility support data.
-   The AG WG does not perform conformance evaluations and reviews.
-   The AG WG does not give guidance on non-web technologies; however, it may cite examples outside the web scope.

### Success Criteria

In order to advance to [Proposed Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR "Proposed Recommendation"), each specification is expected to have [at least two independent implementations](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience) of each of feature defined in the specification.

Each specification should contain a section detailing all known security, privacy, and internationalization implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.

There should be sufficient techniques and tests for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts. To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have [tests](https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html).

Deliverables
------------

More detailed milestones and updated publication schedules are available on the [group publication status page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/project).

*Draft state* indicates the state of the deliverable at the time of the charter approval. *Expected completion* indicates when the deliverable is projected to become a Recommendation, or otherwise reach a stable state.

### Normative Specifications

The Working Group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:

[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/)  
This specification defines updated guidelines to make web content and applications accessible to people with disabilities, updating WCAG 2.1 with additional guidance to better address needs for users with low vision or cognitive disabilities, and users of touch and mobile interfaces. Candidate Success Criteria will be vetted according to careful [WCAG 2.2 Success Criterion Acceptance Criteria](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/requirements/22/#success-criterion-acceptance-criteria) and follow a methodical and consistent working process.

**Draft state:** [Editor's Draft](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/)

**Expected completion:** Q4 2020

[New standard to succeed WCAG 2.x based on the work of the Silver Task Force](https://w3c.github.io/silver/guidelines/) (name to be decided)  
This specification creates a new framework and guidelines to make web content and applications accessible to people with disabilities, supporting a wider set of user needs, using new approaches to testing, and allowing more frequent maintenance of guidelines to keep pace with accelerating technology change. Each guideline in the new standard will focus on user needs rather than structural features or types of content, and will be supported by technology-specific methods to meet that need. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 is expected to substantially conform to a conformance level of the new standard, though the new standard is expected to have many differences from WCAG 2.x. Since the new standard will use a different conformance model, the Working Group expects that some organizations may wish to continue using WCAG 2.x, while others may wish to migrate to the new standard. For those that wish to migrate to the new standard, the Working Group will provide transition support materials, which may use mapping and / or other approaches to facilitate migration.

**Draft state:** [Editor's Draft](https://w3c.github.io/silver/guidelines/)

**Expected completion:** Q2 2023 (<span class="note">Note: this is a projected date after the expiry of this charter and will be revised in a subsequent charter based on progess.</span>)

### Other Deliverables

Other non-normative documents may be created such as:

-   Working Group Notes to support understanding and interpretation of other deliverables as the need arises.
-   Ongoing updates of non-normative resources to understand and implement guidance, including the current [Understanding WCAG 2.x](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/) and [Techniques for WCAG 2.x](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/) as well as new resources to support implementation of the new standard.
-   [Updates to Guidance on Applying WCAG 2.0 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/) (WCAG2ICT).
-   [Requirements for WCAG 2.2](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/requirements/22/) realized via the [WCAG 2.2 Working Process](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/WCAG_2.2_working_process).
-   [Requirements for the new standard](https://w3c.github.io/silver/requirements/), noting that it is a living document and this charter defines the scope of the groupâ€™s work.
-   Mapping guidance and / or other materials to support transition between WCAG 2.x and the new standard.
-   Working Group Notes supporting the [Accessibility Conformance Rules Format 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format-1.0/), and other non-normative publications such as instances of ACT Rules.
-   Errata for WCAG 2.0 and 2.1.

### Timeline

-   January 2020: First Public Working Draft of WCAG 2.2
-   February 2020: First Public Working Draft of the new standard
-   May 2020: WCAG 2.2 Candidate Recommendation
-   November 2020: WCAG 2.2 Recommendation
-   April 2022: Candidate Recommendation of the new standard
-   April 2023: Recommendation of the new standard (<span class="note">Note: this is a projected date after the expiry of this charter and will be revised in a subsequent charter based on progess.</span>)

Coordination
------------

For all specifications, this Working Group will seek [horizontal review](https://www.w3.org/Guide/process/charter.html#horizontal-review) for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the [TAG](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/ "Technical Architecture Group"). Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including [FPWD](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD "First Public Working Draft") and at least 3 months before [CR](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR "Candidate Recommendation"), and should be issued when major changes occur in a specification.

Participation
-------------

To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 15 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementers of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute four hours per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.

Key implementers of WCAG (desktop and non-desktop environments) include Web content developers (page authors, site designers, etc.), Web authoring tool developers, Web accessibility evaluation tool developers, user agent tool developers, and people with disabilities.

The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in [Communication](#communication).

The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the [W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/).

Communication
-------------

Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in [public](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels): the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.

Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the [Accessibility Guidelines Working Group home page.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/)

Most Accessibility Guidelines Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.

This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a href="mailto:w3c-wai-gl@w3.org" id="public-name">w3c-wai-gl@w3.org</a> ([archive](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/)) or on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues" id="public-github">GitHub issues</a>. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.

The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

Decision Policy
---------------

This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the [W3C Process Document (section 3.3](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus)). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.

However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.

The Working Group maintains specific procedures to establish and measure consensus and address objections in the [AG Working Group Decision Policy](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/decision-policy).

This charter is written in accordance with the [W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes) and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

Patent Policy
-------------

This Working Group operates under the [W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/) (Version of 5 February 2004 updated 1 August 2017). To promote the widest adoption of Web standards, W3C seeks to issue Recommendations that can be implemented, according to this policy, on a Royalty-Free basis. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group, please see the [W3C Patent Policy Implementation](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/).
