        <h1>AG WG Decision Policy</h1>
        <p>
          This document explains the decision process of the
          <a href="./">AG Working Group</a>. It was
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/09/15-wai-wcag-minutes#item02"
            >accepted by the Working Group 15 September 2015</a
          >. It was updated editorially 27 January 2017 to change the name of
          the WG to "Accessibility Guidelines Working Group" and to add links to
          referenced resources. A substantive update was
          <a
            href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2018OctDec/0095.html"
            >approved 20 November 2018</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Working Group follows the
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"
            >W3C Process Document</a
          >
          regarding decisions. This document provides additional detail about
          the consensus decision-making process.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Working Group strives to reach consensus via unanimous agreement.
          However, at times unanimity is not possible, and for the sake of
          continuing to work on important topics the group must arrive at a
          consensus decision and move forward. In the course of establishing
          consensus it is critical that all participants have the opportunity to
          express their views for consideration so that all relevant information
          can be used in arriving at the conclusion. Consensus indicates that a
          substantial number of individuals in the group support a proposal, and
          within the AG Working Group consensus can be achieved through this
          process.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#Consensus"
            >Consensus</a
          >
          is not a vote. The exact number of working group participants
          supporting a Call for Consensus compared to objections is not the only
          factor in the decision. Although significant support from the active
          membership is always desirable, consensus means working through
          objections until they are resolved either through amending the
          decision or in rare cases overriding the objection as laid out in
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#managing-dissent"
            >Managing Dissent</a
          >. In order to work through objections they must have a clear
          rationale based on the technical merit or with reference to the agreed
          scope of the work. Moving on usually means a careful approach is
          taken. For example, <em>not</em> adding something to the
          documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additions to normative text such as new success criteria should have a
          pre-defined scope. For example, the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/WCAG_2.1_Success_Criteria"
            >requirements for WCAG 2.1 success criteria</a
          >. Where new normative text does not reach consensus the reasons
          should be recorded, depending on the origin of the text. For example,
          if the new text originated in a github issue or pull request, it could
          be labeled with "Unsupported addition".
        </p>
        <p>
          During discussion on a topic, participants are welcome to raise
          objections freely to help ensure that all available information can be
          considered and contribute to the best possible decision. However, when
          the chairs issue a Call for Consensus, objections should not be raised
          unless the individual strongly believes the decision is the wrong one
          in spite of discussion, and the individual cannot "live with" the
          decision. Compromise on points that the individual considers
          suboptimal but can "live with" is an essential part of group decisions
          that must meet various requirements.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Discussion on a topic proceeds until the chairs believe that all
            points of view have been expressed and the group has considered the
            variety of information presented. Depending on the topic, this
            discussion may take a couple of days or a couple of weeks, or more.
            <ol>
              <li>
                Discussion can take place in any
                <a href="./communication"
                  >recognized channel of the Working Group</a
                >
                including email on the AG mailing list, comment threads for
                GitHub issues or pull requests, or on Working Group calls.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            When the chairs believe that the group is ready to come to a
            decision they announce a Call for Consensus by email to the Working
            Group's mailing list. The Call must remain open for a minimum of two
            working days.
            <ol>
              <li>The Call is open to responses from all group members.</li>
              <li>
                The Call will be for a single topic, will clearly indicate that
                it is a Call for Consensus, and will contain pointers to the
                relevant discussion. This may include links to GitHub issues or
                pull requests, AG surveys, email threads, or meeting minutes.
              </li>
              <li>
                A resolution recorded in a WG teleconference may precede a Call
                for Consensus, but it may not replace the official Call for
                Consensus.
              </li>
              <li>
                Issues that are regarded as editorial by the Chairs do not
                require a Working Group decision in order for the Chairs to
                address, and thus do not require a Call for Consensus. If there
                is disagreement by participants on whether something is
                editorial this can be brought to the attention of the chairs
                either privately or in the context of the wider group.
              </li>

            Evaluating the Call for Consensus.
            <ol>
              <li>
                If no objections are received by the deadline, the draft
                decision becomes a formal decision of the Working Group.
              </li>
              <li>
                If objections are received but the chairs believe the objections
                have already been considered as far as is possible and
                reasonable, and the reviewers providing the objections can "live
                with” the decision, the draft decision becomes a formal decision
                of the Working Group.
              </li>
              <li>
                If objections are received that the chairs believe present
                substantive new information or if the chairs believe there is
                not a clear consensus in the Working Group, they will reopen the
                discussion, as detailed in
                <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGChairReopen"
                  >section 3.3.4 of the Process Document (Reopening a Decision
                  When Presented With New Information)</a
                >.
              </li>
              <li>
                If working group member(s) continue to disagree and the chairs
                do not believe it presents substantive new information, or it
                does not meet the criteria established for adding new normative
                content, the chairs may decide the draft decision becomes a
                formal decision of the Working Group despite the objection.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            The Working Group chairs record the Formal Decisions on the
            <a href="./wiki/Decisions">AG Decisions page</a> on the wiki. The
            change to the WCAG documents is incorporated into the editors draft
            and recorded in the appropriate change log.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the rare situation where a
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#FormalObjection"
              >formal objection</a
            >
            is raised all the Chairs and staff contact(s) will come to an
            agreement about the issue and may record a decision with objections
            per
            <a
              href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGArchiveMinorityViews"
              >section 3.3.2 of the Process Document (Recording and Reporting
              Formal Objections)</a
            >
            and work to address the issue as described in
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#formal-address"

        <p>
          Other aspects of the Working Group decision policy are defined in the
          Process Document, including
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes"
            >Votes (section 3.4)</a
          >

            >Appeal of a Chair’s Decision (section 3.5)</a
          >. If a participant believes the Chairs have not exercised sound
          judgment in following this policy, they should express their concern
          first to one of the Working Group Chairs, escalating if needed to the
          AG staff contact, and escalating if needed to the W3C Web
