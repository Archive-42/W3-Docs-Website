Help with the WAI Web Site
==========================

Page Contents
-------------

Some pages have "Page Contents" lists with in-page (or "anchor") links. Selecting these links jumps down to that section within the current page.

-   [Navigating with Headings](#headings)
-   [Skip to Content](#skiphelp)

<span id="mainnav">WAI Site Navigation</span>
---------------------------------------------

The primary WAI site navigation is displayed in most graphical browsers in a light blue bar along the left of the page. If you are using a screen reader or have style sheets turned off, the navigation is under heading 2 "Site Navigation".

When you click an item in the navigation area, that page is loaded in your browser. Related pages are shown in the navigation area as an outline (with nested lists). The current page is indicated in the navigation with:  
<span class="current-page">»</span>**Current page**

The [WAI Site Map](sitemap) shows the **site navigation outline expanded with all pages listed**.

<span id="headings">Navigating with Headings</span>
---------------------------------------------------

The WAI site is designed for navigation using headings. Most pages include:

-   Site Navigation (heading level 2)
-   \[page title\] (heading level 1)
-   Page Contents (heading level 2) - on pages with several sections
-   Sidebar (heading level 2) - for photos, icon descriptions, and other related information
-   \[various\] (heading level 2) - subheadings within the main content of the page
-   Document Information (heading level 2) - contact links and other footer information

Most assistive technologies and some browsers facilitate**navigation by headings**.

-   Common **screen readers** provide functionality to jump to the next heading, for example:
    -   H moves to the next heading
    -   1 goes to the next level 1 heading
    -   2 goes to the next level 2 heading
    -   INSERT+F6 provides a list of headings, which can be sorted in tab order or in alphabetical order
-   In the latest version of the **voicing browser** Home Page Reader**:**
    -   H moves to the next heading
    -   Alt+1 sets Headings Reading Mode, then the down arrow key moves to the next heading and the up arrow key moves to the previous heading
-   In the **browser** Opera:
    -   S moves to the next heading
    -   W move to the previous heading

### <span id="accesskeys">Access Keys</span>

The WAI site does not include access keys for several reasons, including:

-   potential conflicts with browser and assistive technology access keys,
-   navigation provided through other means, including headings as described above.

<span id="skiphelp">Skip to Content</span>
------------------------------------------

The "Skip to content" link at the beginning of the page (usually displayed in the gray bar) moves the focus to the start of the main content (for example, for screen readers to skip the navigation).

(Internet Explorer 6.0 moves the visual focus, but not the input focus.)

<span id="change-text">Change Text Size or Colors</span>
--------------------------------------------------------

Instructions for [How to Change Text Size or Colors](changedesign) is on another Web page.

<span id="icons">Icons</span>
-----------------------------

The following icons are used on the WAI site:

-   ![different format](/Icons/tr.png) icon indicates links to technical reports or other page formats without WAI site navigation. The alternative text description for this image is "technical report", "W3C Note", or "different format" depending on the type of pages it links to.
-   ![links off W3C WAI site](/Icons/offsite.png) icon indicates links to off W3C WAI site.

<span id="image">About the Picture at the Top of the Page</span>
----------------------------------------------------------------

At the top of most pages in the WAI site is an image of a bridge. On one side of the image is the strong, concrete base of the bridge. Water is flowing under the bridge, around the bridge supports. The sun is shining and on the other side of the image are green trees.

<span id="disclaimer">Note: No Software Endorsement</span>
----------------------------------------------------------

W3C WAI does not endorse specific Web browsers, assistive technologies, or other products, and does not recommend one over another. While some common products are included in this page, mention of a specific product does not imply endorsement or recommendation.
