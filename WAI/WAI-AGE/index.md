<span id="about">About WAI-AGE</span>
-------------------------------------

The WAI-AGE Project is a completed European Commission IST Specific Support Action with the goal of increasing accessibility of the Web for older people as well as for people with disabilities. The project has the following main objectives to:

-   **inform the development of extensions on WAI guidelines** and supplemental educational materials which can better promote and meet the needs of people who have accessibility needs related to ageing, with particular relevance to the needs of older people in Europe;
-   **better inform the ongoing work of W3C/WAI with regard to the needs of older people**, and to create an ongoing dialog between ageing communities and disability communities, and other stakeholder groups on the needs of people who have accessibility needs related to ageing;
-   **provide educational resources focused towards industry implementors**, including developers of mainstream technologies, assistive technologies, and Web designers and developers, through reviewing and revising existing WAI educational resources, and developing new educational resources which support the promotion and implementation of Web accessibility solutions for people with accessibility needs due to ageing;
-   **provide educational resources focused towards organizations representing and serving ageing communities**, and towards individuals with accessibility needs related to ageing, through reviewing and revising existing WAI educational resources and to develop new educational resources which support promotion and implementation of Web accessibility solutions for people with accessibility needs due to ageing;
-   **promote increased harmonisation of Web accessibility standards** so as to further build a unified market for technology developers and expedite the production of Web accessibility solutions, through promoting ongoing dialog between organisations representing the needs of the ageing community, and educating standards organisations and policy makers on commonalities between the needs of people with disabilities and people with accessibility needs due to ageing.

WAI continues to welcome contributions by researchers, developers and users interested in web accessibility for older people. See [participating in WAI](http://www.w3.org/WAI/participation) for more information on different opportunities to contribute.
