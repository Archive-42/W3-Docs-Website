Introduction
------------

WAI-DA is a European Commission IST Accompanying Measure whose goal is to increase accessibility of the Web in European Union member states. This objective will be accomplished by supporting and accompanying the technical and guidelines development work done at [W3C WAI](/WAI) with educational and tools-related activities that are specific to the European context.

Judy Brewer (W3C/MIT, jbrewer@w3.org[](mailto:jbrewer@w3.org)) and Daniel Dardailler (W3C/INRIA, danield@w3.org) are the contact persons for the project and W3C/INRIA is the Prime Contractor.

The project runs for 24 months and has 3 main objectives for increasing the accessibility of the Web within European Union member states:

-   increase the extent of participation of individuals and organizations from European Union member states in international activities promoting Web accessibility through the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), so as to increase the activity within Europe dedicated to Web accessibility, and at the same time increase the relevance to the European situation of the international W3C/WAI work (WP03);
-   increase awareness and implementation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines on Web sites within European Union member states, in order to increase the usability of European Web sites by people with disabilities (WP04); and
-   increase the implementation of the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines in Web authoring tools used in European Union member states, so that people producing Web sites will more automatically be able to create accessible sites using these tools (WP05).

Timeline
--------

The project was designed during the first half of 2000 and officially started on October 1st 2000. In early 2001, we selected our two subcontractors: BrailleNet, in the person of Sylvie Duchateau, and ISdAC with Carlos Velasco.
