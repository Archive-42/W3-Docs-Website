### RTC Accessibility User Requirements (RAUR) Note Published

<span class="small">(2021-05-25)</span>

[RTC Accessibility User Requirements (RAUR)](https://www.w3.org/TR/raur/) is published as a Working Group Note. Real-time communication (RTC) provides real-time peer to peer audio, video, and data exchange directly between supported user agents. This enables instantaneous applications for video and audio calls, text chat, file exchange, screen sharing, and gaming. RAUR describes various accessibility related user needs, requirements, and scenarios for real-time communication (RTC) applications. These user needs should drive accessibility requirements in various related specifications and the overall architecture that enables RTC.

### Accessibility Translations: Getting the 'Global' in GAAD

<span class="small">(2021-05-20)</span>

[All WAI Translations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/translations/) now lists translations in 35 languages. Thanks to the translators. (If you know anyone who might be interested in contributing to more accessibility translations, please point them to: [Translating WAI Resources](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/translating/))

<span class="small">(2021-05-18)</span>

[Specification for Spoken Presentation in HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/WD-spoken-html-20210518/) Working Draft is ready for review. This document is part of [W3C work on pronunciation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/pronunciation/) to provide normative specifications and best practices guidance so that text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis can properly pronounce HTML content. This Draft specification describes two possible technical approaches for author-controlled pronunciation. W3C is seeking more input on these approaches, particularly from content authors and implementors. Please send comments by **18 June 2021**.

<span class="small">(2021-05-13)</span>

[WCAG 2.2 Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) is ready wide review before finalizing WCAG 2.2. This draft has 9 new “success criteria” (requirements) since WCAG 2.1. The new success criteria and changes since the previous 2.2 draft are introduced in [What's New in WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/). The new success criteria address user needs of people with cognitive or learning disabilities, users of mobile devices, and users of ebooks. Please submit comments by 11 June 2021.

### Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities - Note Published
