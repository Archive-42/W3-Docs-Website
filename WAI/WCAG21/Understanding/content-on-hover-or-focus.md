Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.13: Content on Hover or Focus
=================================================================

> Success Criterion [1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#content-on-hover-or-focus) (Level AA): Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true:
>
> Dismissible  
> A [mechanism](#dfn-mechanism) is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an [input error](#dfn-input-error) or does not obscure or replace other content;
>
> Hoverable  
> If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing;
>
> Persistent  
> The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid.
>
> Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author.
>
> Examples of additional content controlled by the user agent include browser tooltips created through use of the HTML [`title` attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#the-title-attribute).
>
> Custom tooltips, sub-menus, and other nonmodal popups that display on hover and focus are examples of additional content covered by this criterion.

Intent
------

Additional content that appears and disappears in coordination with keyboard focus or pointer hover often leads to accessibility issues. Reasons for such issues include:

1.  the user may not have intended to trigger the interaction
2.  the user may not know new content has appeared
3.  the new content may intefere with a user's ability to do a task

Examples of such interactions can include custom tooltips, sub-menus and other nonmodal popups which display on hover and focus. The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that authors who cause additional content to appear and disappear in this manner must design the interaction in such a way that users can:

-   perceive the additional content AND
-   dismiss it without disrupting their page experience.

There are usually more predictable and accessible means of adding content to the page, which authors are recommended to employ. If an author *does* choose to make additional content appear and disappear in coordination with hover and keyboard focus, this success criterion specifies three conditions that must be met:

-   dismissable
-   hoverable
-   persistent

Each of these is discussed in a separate section.

Note

This SC covers content that appears in addition to the triggering component itself. Therefore, a non-visible component, like a Skip to Main link, that is made visible on keyboard focus (with no *additional* content beyond the trigger becoming visible) is not covered by the SC.

### Dismissable

The intent of this condition is to ensure that the additional content does not interfere with viewing or operating the page's original content. When magnified, the portion of the page visible in the viewport can be significantly reduced. Mouse users frequently move the pointer to pan the magnified viewport and display another portion of the screen. However, almost the entire portion of the page visible in this restricted viewport may trigger the additional content, making it difficult for a user to pan without re-triggering the content. A keyboard means of dismissing the additional content provides a workaround.

Alternatively, low vision users who can only navigate via the keyboard do not want the small area of their magnified viewport cluttered with hover text. They need a keyboard method of dismissing something that is obscuring the current focal area.

Two methods may be used to satisfy this condition and prevent such interference:

1.  Position the additional content so that it does not obscure any other content including the trigger, with the exception of white space and purely decorative content, such as a background graphic which provides no information.
2.  Provide a mechanism to easily dismiss the additional content, such as by pressing Escape.

For most triggers of relatively small size, it is desirable for both methods to be implemented. If the trigger is large, noticing the additional content may be of concern if it appears away from the trigger. In those cases, only the second method may be appropriate.

The success criteria allows for input error messages to persist as there are cases that require attention, explicit confirmation or remedial action.

### Hoverable

The intent of this condition is to ensure that additional content which may appear on hover of a target may also be hovered itself. Content which appears on hover can be difficult or impossible to perceive if a user is required to keep their mouse pointer over the trigger. When the added content is large, magnified views may mean that the user needs to scroll or pan to completely view it, which is impossible unless the user is able to move their pointer off the trigger without the additional content disappearing.

Another common situation is when large pointers have been selected via platform settings or assistive technology. Here, the pointer can obscure a significant area of the additional content. A technique to view the content fully in both situations is to move the mouse pointer directly from the trigger onto the new content. This capability also offers significant advantages for users who utilize screen reader feedback on mouse interactions. This condition generally implies that the additional content overlaps or is positioned adjacent to the target.

### Persistent

The intent of this condition is to ensure users have adequate time to perceive the additional content after it becomes visible. Users with disabilities may require more time for many reasons, such as to change magnification, move the pointer, or simply to bring the new content into their visual field. Once it appears, the content should remain visible until:

-   The user removes hover or focus from the trigger and the additional content, consistent with the typical user experience;
-   The user dismisses the additional content via the mechanism provided to satisfy the Dismissable condition; or
-   The information conveyed by the additional content becomes invalid, such as a 'busy' message that is no longer valid.

### Additional Notes

-   This criterion does not attempt to solve such issues when the appearance of the additional content is completely controlled by the user agent. A prominent example is the common behavior of browsers to display the `title`Â  attribute in HTML as a small tooltip.
-   Modal dialogs are out of scope for this criterion because they must take keyboard focus and thus should not appear on hover or focus. Refer to [Success Criterion 3.2.1, On Focus](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#on-focus).
-   Content which can be triggered via pointer hover should also be able to be triggered by keyboard focus. Refer to [Success Criterion 2.1.1, Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#keyboard).

Benefits
--------

-   Users with low vision who view content under magnification will be better able to view content on hover or focus without reducing their desired magnification.
-   Users who increase the size of mouse cursors via platform settings or assistive technology will be able to employ a technique to view obscured content on hover.
-   Users with low vision or cognitive disabilities will have adequate time to perceive additional content appearing on hover or focus and to view the trigger content with less distraction.
-   users with low pointer accuracy will be able to more easily dismiss unintentionally-triggered additional content

Examples
--------

### Example 1: Dismissable Tooltip

![Figure 1 A tooltip is displayed below a LVTF button on hover so as not to obscure the button itself. It does however obscure content below the button (the next red button, called ~comment-zoom-content). To meet the Dismissible requirement, a user can press the Escape key to clear the tooltip without moving the mouse, as demonstrated in the second image.](img/button-pointer-tooltip.png)

![Figure 2 The button's tooltip also appears on focus and can be removed with the Escape key. The screen shot shows the same LVTF button with focus, but the tooltip has been dismissed and is no longer visible.](img/button-focus-indicator.png)

### Example 2: Hoverable Tooltip

![Figure 3 A button's tooltip is displayed directly below it on mouse hover which can easily be obscured by a large pointer. The tooltip itself is able to be hovered so the mouse pointer can be moved down to its bottom edge in order to view the tooltip text.](img/button-pointer-on-tooltip.png)

Key Terms
---------

assistive technology

hardware and/or software that acts as a [user agent](#dfn-user-agent), or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents

Note

functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations (e.g., to make tables more accessible).

Note

Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents by using and monitoring APIs.

Note

The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute. Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles.

Assistive technologies that are important in the context of this document include the following:

-   screen magnifiers, and other visual reading assistants, which are used by people with visual, perceptual and physical print disabilities to change text font, size, spacing, color, synchronization with speech, etc. in order to improve the visual readability of rendered text and images;
-   screen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information through synthesized speech or braille;
-   text-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech;
-   speech recognition software, which may be used by people who have some physical disabilities;
-   alternative keyboards, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate the keyboard (including alternate keyboards that use head pointers, single switches, sip/puff and other special input devices.);
-   alternative pointing devices, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate mouse pointing and button activations.

Note

Although any "other resources" would be rendered together with the primary resource, they would not necessarily be rendered simultaneously with each other.

Note

For the purposes of conformance with these guidelines, a resource must be "non-embedded" within the scope of conformance to be considered a Web page.

A Web resource including all embedded images and media.

A Web mail program built using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX). The program lives entirely at http://example.com/mail, but includes an inbox, a contacts area and a calendar.
