Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value
========================================================

> Success Criterion [4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#name-role-value) (Level A): For all [user interface components](#dfn-user-interface-component) (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the [name](#dfn-name) and [role](#dfn-role) can be [programmatically determined](#dfn-programmatically-determined); states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be [programmatically set](#dfn-programmatically-set); and notification of changes to these items is available to [user agents](#dfn-user-agent), including [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technology).
>
> This success criterion is primarily for Web authors who develop or script their own user interface components. For example, standard HTML controls already meet this success criterion when used according to specification.

Intent
------

The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that Assistive Technologies (AT) can gather information about, activate(or set) and keep up to date on the status of user interface controls in the content.

When standard controls from accessible technologies are used, this process is straightforward. If the user interface elements are used according to specification the conditions of this provision will be met. (See examples of Success Criterion 4.1.2 below)

If custom controls are created, however, or interface elements are programmed (in code or script) to have a different role and/or function than usual, then additional measures need to be taken to ensure that the controls provide important information to assistive technologies and allow themselves to be controlled by assistive technologies.

A particularly important state of a user interface control is whether or not it has focus. The focus state of a control can be programmatically determined, and notifications about change of focus are sent to user agents and assistive technology. Other examples of user interface control state are whether or not a checkbox or radio button has been selected, or whether or not a collapsible tree or list node is expanded or collapsed.

Note

Success Criterion 4.1.2 requires a programmatically determinable name for all user interface components. Names may be visible or invisible. Occasionally, the name must be visible, in which case it is identified as a label. Refer to the definition of name and label in the glossary for more information.

Benefits
--------

-   Providing role, state, and value information on all user interface components enables compatibility with assistive technology, such as screen readers, screen magnifiers, and speech recognition software, used by people with disabilities.

Examples
--------

-   **Accessible APIs**

    A Java applet uses the accessibility API defined by the language.

Key Terms
---------

ascii art

picture created by a spatial arrangement of characters or glyphs (typically from the 95 printable characters defined by ASCII)

assistive technology

hardware and/or software that acts as a [user agent](#dfn-user-agent), or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents

Note

functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations (e.g., to make tables more accessible).

Note

Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents by using and monitoring APIs.

Note

The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute. Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles.

Assistive technologies that are important in the context of this document include the following:

-   screen magnifiers, and other visual reading assistants, which are used by people with visual, perceptual and physical print disabilities to change text font, size, spacing, color, synchronization with speech, etc. in order to improve the visual readability of rendered text and images;
-   screen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information through synthesized speech or braille;
-   text-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech;
-   speech recognition software, which may be used by people who have some physical disabilities;
-   alternative keyboards, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate the keyboard (including alternate keyboards that use head pointers, single switches, sip/puff and other special input devices.);
-   alternative pointing devices, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate mouse pointing and button activations.

content

information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a [user agent](#dfn-user-agent), including code or markup that defines the content's [structure](#dfn-structure), [presentation](#dfn-presentation), and interactions

human language

language that is spoken, written or signed (through visual or tactile means) to communicate with humans

Note

See also [sign language](#dfn-sign-language).

label

[text](#dfn-text) or other component with a [text alternative](#dfn-text-alternative) that is presented to a user to identify a component within Web [content](#dfn-content)

Note

A label is presented to all users whereas the [name](#dfn-name) may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology. In many (but not all) cases the name and the label are the same.

Note

The term label is not limited to the label element in HTML.

name

text by which software can identify a component within Web content to the user

Note

The name may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology, whereas a [label](#dfn-label) is presented to all users. In many (but not all) cases, the label and the name are the same.

Note

This is unrelated to the name attribute in HTML.

non-text content

any content that is not a sequence of characters that can be [programmatically determined](#dfn-programmatically-determined) or where the sequence is not expressing something in [human language](#dfn-human-language)

Note

This includes [ASCII Art](#dfn-ascii-art) (which is a pattern of characters), emoticons, leetspeak (which uses character substitution), and images representing text

presentation

rendering of the [content](#dfn-content) in a form to be perceived by users

programmatically determined

determined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that different [user agents](#dfn-user-agent), including [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technology), can extract and present this information to users in different modalities

Note

Determined in a markup language from elements and attributes that are accessed directly by commonly available assistive technology.

Note

Determined from technology-specific data structures in a non-markup language and exposed to assistive technology via an accessibility API that is supported by commonly available assistive technology.

programmatically set

set by software using methods that are supported by user agents, including assistive technologies

role

text or number by which software can identify the function of a component within Web content

A number that indicates whether an image functions as a hyperlink, command button, or check box.

sign language

a language using combinations of movements of the hands and arms, facial expressions, or body positions to convey meaning

structure

1.  The way the parts of a [Web page](#dfn-web-page) are organized in relation to each other; and
2.  The way a collection of [Web pages](#dfn-web-page) is organized

text

sequence of characters that can be [programmatically determined](#dfn-programmatically-determined), where the sequence is expressing something in [human language](#dfn-human-language)

text alternative

[Text](#dfn-text) that is programmatically associated with [non-text content](#dfn-non-text-content) or referred to from text that is programmatically associated with non-text content. Programmatically associated text is text whose location can be programmatically determined from the non-text content.

An image of a chart is described in text in the paragraph after the chart. The short text alternative for the chart indicates that a description follows.

Note

Refer to [Understanding Text Alternatives](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance) for more information.

user agent

any software that retrieves and presents Web content for users

Web browsers, media players, plug-ins, and other programs — including [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technology) — that help in retrieving, rendering, and interacting with Web content.

user interface component

a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function

Note

Multiple user interface components may be implemented as a single programmatic element. Components here is not tied to programming techniques, but rather to what the user perceives as separate controls.

Note

User interface components include form elements and links as well as components generated by scripts.

Note

What is meant by "component" or "user interface component" here is also sometimes called "user interface element".

An applet has a "control" that can be used to move through content by line or page or random access. Since each of these would need to have a name and be settable independently, they would each be a "user interface component."

web page

a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a [user agent](#dfn-user-agent)

Note

Although any "other resources" would be rendered together with the primary resource, they would not necessarily be rendered simultaneously with each other.

Note

For the purposes of conformance with these guidelines, a resource must be "non-embedded" within the scope of conformance to be considered a Web page.

A Web resource including all embedded images and media.

A Web mail program built using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX). The program lives entirely at http://example.com/mail, but includes an inbox, a contacts area and a calendar. Links or buttons are provided that cause the inbox, contacts, or calendar to display, but do not change the URI of the page as a whole.

A customizable portal site, where users can choose content to display from a set of different content modules.

When you enter "http://shopping.example.com/" in your browser, you enter a movie-like interactive shopping environment where you visually move around in a store dragging products off of the shelves around you and into a visual shopping cart in front of you. Clicking on a product causes it to be demonstrated with a specification sheet floating alongside. This might be a single-page Web site or just one page within a Web site.
