Understanding Success Criterion 3.3.5: Help
===========================================

> Success Criterion [3.3.5 Help](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#help) (Level AAA): [Context-sensitive help](#dfn-context-sensitive-help) is available.

Intent
------

The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users avoid making mistakes. Some users with disabilities may be more likely to make mistakes than users without disabilities. Using context-sensitive help, users find out how to perform an operation without losing track of what they are doing.

Context-sensitive help only needs to be provided when the label is not sufficient to describe all functionality. The existence of context-sensitive help should be obvious to the user and they should be able to obtain it whenever they require it.

The content author may provide the help text, or the user agent may provide the help text based on technology-specific, programmatically determined information.

Benefits
--------

-   Assistance for text input helps individuals with writing disabilities and people with reading and intellectual disabilities who often have difficulty writing text in forms or other places that need text input.
-   Additionally, these kinds of assistance help people who are aging and have the same difficulty in text input and/or mouse operation.

Examples
--------

-   **on-line job application**

    Some of the questions may be hard for new job seekers to understand. A help link next to each question provides instructions and explanations for each question.

Techniques
----------

Each numbered item in this section represents a technique or combination of techniques that the WCAG Working Group deems sufficient for meeting this Success Criterion. However, it is not necessary to use these particular techniques. For information on using other techniques, see [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](understanding-techniques), particularly the "Other Techniques" section.
