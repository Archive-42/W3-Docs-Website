Abstract
--------

This document records all known errors in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) specification.

The errata are numbered, classified as [Substantive](#substantive) or [Editorial](#editorial), and listed in reverse chronological order of their date of publication in each category.

Each entry has the following information:

-   A unique entry number
-   The date it was added to the errata page.
-   The section referred to.
-   A description of the problem and correction if applicable.
-   A rationale for making the change (not required for editorial errata).

Substantive corrections are proposed by the [Accessibility Guidelines Working Group](http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/), which has consensus that they are appropriate; they are not to be considered normative until a new Recommendation is published following the [process to revise a Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#revised-rec).

Please view the [public comment instructions](/WAI/WCAG20/comments/) if you would like to comment to the Working Group. Comments submitted are publicly available in the [archive for the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group public comments mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-agwg-comments/).
