Failure of Success Criterion 2.4.2 due to the title of a Web page not identifying the contents
==============================================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

All technologies.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 2.4.2: Page Titled](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/page-titled) (Failure).

Description
-----------

This describes a failure condition when the Web page has a title, but the title does not identify the contents or purpose of the Web page.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

Examples of text that are not titles include:

-   Authoring tool default titles, such as

    -   "Enter the title of your HTML document here,"
    -   "Untitled Document"
    -   "No Title"
    -   "Untitled Page"
    -   "New Page 1"

-   Filenames that are not descriptive in their own right, such as "report.html" or "spk12.html"
-   Empty text
-   Filler or placeholder text

### Example 2

A site generated using templates includes the same title for each page on the site. So the title cannot be used to distinguish among the pages.
