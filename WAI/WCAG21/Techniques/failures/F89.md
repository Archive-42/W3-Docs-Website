Failure of Success Criteria 2.4.4, 2.4.9 and 4.1.2 due to not providing an accessible name for an image which is the only content in a link
===========================================================================================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

Content that contains links.

This technique relates to:

-   [Success Criterion 2.4.4: Link Purpose (In Context)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context) (Failure)
-   [Success Criterion 2.4.9: Link Purpose (Link Only)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-link-only) (Failure)
-   [Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value) (Failure)

Description
-----------

This failure condition occurs when a link contains only non-text content, such as an image, and that link cannot be identified by an accessible name. The accessible name for a link is defined according to the [Accessible Name and Description Computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname/).

This also applies when both text and images are used separately on a page to link to the same target. In this case success technique [H2: Combining adjacent image and text links for the same resource](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H2) is the recommended approach to reduce the number of separate links and the undesirable redundancy.

Examples
--------

### Example 1: HTML Search Results

A search site returns search results that include both a text link and an image link to the match site. The image has a null `alt` attribute, since the result already contains a link with a text description. However, the screen reader does not ignore the image link but uses heuristics to find some text that might describe the purpose of the link. For example, the screen reader might announce, "football dot gif Football Scorecard."

     <a href="scores.html">
       <img src="football.gif" alt="" />
     </a>
     <a href="scores.html">
       Football Scoreboard
     </a>
    }

-   [ARIA8: Using aria-label for link purpose](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA8)

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  Check whether the link contains only non-text content.
2.  Check whether the non-text content has been implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technologies, such as using role="presentation" or alt="" .
3.  Check that the link does not have an accessible name provided in another way such as `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.

### Expected Results

-   If all checks are true, then this failure condition applies and the content fails the success criteria.
