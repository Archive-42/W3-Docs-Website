Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.2 due to including scrolling content where movement is not essential to the activity without also including a mechanism to pause and restart the content
=========================================================================================================================================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

All technologies that support visual movement or scrolling.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 2.2.2: Pause, Stop, Hide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pause-stop-hide) (Failure).

Description
-----------

In this failure technique, there is moving or scrolling content that cannot be paused and resumed by users. In this case, some users with low vision or cognitive disabilities will not be able to perceive the content.

Examples
--------

-   A page has a scrolling news ticker without a mechanism to pause it. Some users are unable to read the scrolling content.

Tests

### Procedure

On a page with moving or scrolling content,

1.  Check that a mechanism is provided in the Web page or user agent to pause moving or scrolling content.
2.  Use the pause mechanism to pause the moving or scrolling content.
3.  Check that the moving or scrolling has stopped and does not restart by itself.
4.  Check that a mechanism is provided in the Web page or user agent to restart the paused content.
5.  Use the restart mechanism provided to restart the moving content.
6.  Check that the movement or scrolling has resumed from the point where it was stopped.

### Expected Results

-   If step \#1, step \#3, step \#4, or step \#6 are false, then the content fails the success criterion.
