Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.2 due to a script that causes a blink effect without a mechanism to stop the blinking at 5 seconds or less
===========================================================================================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

Technologies that support script-controlled blinking of content.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 2.2.2: Pause, Stop, Hide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pause-stop-hide) (Failure).

Description
-----------

Scripts can be used to blink content by toggling the content's visibility on and off at regular intervals. It is a failure for the script not to include a mechanism to stop the blinking at 5 seconds or earlier. See [SCR22: Using scripts to control blinking and stop it in five seconds or less](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/client-side-script/SCR22) for information about how to modify the technique to stop the blinking.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

The following example uses script to blink content, but the blink continues indefinitely rather than stopping after five seconds.

    ...
    <script type="text/javascript">
    <!--
    // blink "on" state
    function show()
    {
        if (document.getElementById)
        document.getElementById("blink1").style.visibility = "visible";
        settime-out("hide()", 450);
    }
    // blink "off" state
    function hide()
    {
        if (document.getElementById)
        document.getElementById("blink1").style.visibility = "hidden";
        settime-out("show()", 450);
    }
    // kick it off
    show();
    //-->
    </script>
    ...
    <span id="blink1">This content will blink</span>

Tests

### Procedure

For each instance of blinking content:

1.  Determine if the blinking stops in 5 seconds or less.

### Expected Results

If \#1 is false, then the content fails the Success Criterion.
