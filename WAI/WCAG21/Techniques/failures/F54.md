Failure of Success Criterion 2.1.1 due to using only pointing-device-specific event handlers (including gesture) for a function
===============================================================================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

Technologies that have event handlers specific to pointing devices.

User Agent and Assistive Technology Support Notes

-   None listed.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 2.1.1: Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard) (Failure).

Description
-----------

When pointing device-specific event handlers are the only mechanism available to invoke a function of the content, users with no vision (who cannot use devices such as mice that require eye-hand coordination) as well as users who must use alternate keyboards or input devices that act as keyboard emulators will be unable to access the function of the content.

For Success Criterion 2.1.1 there is an exception for functions that require a path-dependant pointer movement.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

The following example is of an image that responds to a mouse click to go to another page. This is a failure because the keyboard cannot be used to move to the next page. &lt;p&gt;&lt;img onmousedown="nextPage();" src="nextarrow.gif" alt="Go to next page"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  Check to see whether pointing-device-specific event handlers are the only means to invoke scripting functions.
2.  Check if the function being invoked requires input information about a specific path for a pointing device

### Expected Results

-   If check \#1 is true, then this failure condition applies and content fails Success Criterion 2.1.3.
-   If check \#1 is true and check \#2 is false, then this failure condition applies and content fails Success Criteria 2.1.1 and 2.1.3.
