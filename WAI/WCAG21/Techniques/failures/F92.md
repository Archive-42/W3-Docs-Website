Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 due to the use of role presentation on content which conveys semantic information
====================================================================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML and XHTML

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships) (Failure).

Description
-----------

This failure occurs when a role of presentation is applied to an element whose purpose is to convey information or relationships in the content. Elements such as `table`, can convey information about the content contained in them via their semantic markup. The WAI-ARIA role of [`presentation`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#presentation) on the other hand, is intended to suppress semantic information of content from the accessibility API and prevent user agents from conveying that information to the user. Use of the `presentation` role for content which should convey semantic information may prevent the user from understanding that content.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

In this example, tabular data is marked up with role=presentation. Though design layout tables can be marked up in such a way, data tables need to retain their semantic information and should therefore not be marked up with role=presentation.

Example Code:

    <table role="presentation">
       <caption>Fruits and their colors</caption>
       <tr>
         <th>Name</th>
         <th>Color</th>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td scope="row">banana</td>
        <td>yellow</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td scope="row">orange</td>
        <td>orange</td>
       </tr>
      </table>

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  Check if an element which conveys information, structure, or relationships through its semantic markup
2.  Element has the attribute role="presentation".

### Expected Results

-   If check \#2 is true, then this failure condition applies and the content fails the Success Criterion.
