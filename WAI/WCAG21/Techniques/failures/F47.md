Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.2 due to using the blink element
=================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML and XHTML

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 2.2.2: Pause, Stop, Hide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pause-stop-hide) (Failure).

Description
-----------

The blink element, while not part of the official HTML or XHTML specification, is supported by many user agents. It causes any text inside the element to blink at a predetermined rate. This cannot be interrupted by the user, nor can it be disabled as a preference. The blinking continues as long as the page is displayed. Therefore, content that uses blink fails the Success Criterion because blinking can continue for more than three seconds.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

A product list page uses the blink element to draw attention to sale prices. This fails the Success Criterion because users cannot control the blink.

    <p>My Great Product <blink>Sale! $44,995!</blink></p>

Tests

### Expected Results

-   If \#1 is true, the content fails the Success Criterion.
