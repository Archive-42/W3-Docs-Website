Failure of Success Criterion 1.2.2 due to captions omitting some dialogue or important sound effects
====================================================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

Applies to all technologies.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 1.2.2: Captions (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/captions-prerecorded) (Failure).

Description
-----------

This describes a failure condition for all techniques involving captions. If the "caption" does not include all of the dialogue (either verbatim or in essence) as well as all important sounds then the 'Captions' are not real captions.

NOTE: Captions sometimes simplify the spoken text both to make it easier to read and to avoid forcing the viewer to read at very high speed. This is standard procedure and does not invalidate a caption.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

Examples of text streams that are not captions include:

-   text that contains the dialogue (possibly simplified dialogue) but that does not describe important sounds
-   text that omits dialogue during portions of the material

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  View the material with captioning turned on.
2.  Check that all dialogue is accompanied by a caption.
3.  Check that all important sounds are captioned.

### Expected Results

-   If check \#2 and check \#3 are false, then this failure condition applies and the content fails the Success Criterion.
