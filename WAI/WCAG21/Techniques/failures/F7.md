Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.2 due to an object or applet that has blinking content without a mechanism to pause the content that blinks for more than five seconds
=======================================================================================================================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

Technologies that support blinking content within an object, applet, or a plug-in.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 2.2.2: Pause, Stop, Hide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pause-stop-hide) (Failure).

Description
-----------

When content that is rendered by a plug-in or contained in an applet blinks, there may be no way for the user agent to pause the blinking. If neither the plug-in, applet, nor the content itself provides a mechanism to pause the content, the user may not have sufficient time to read the content between blinks or it may be so distracting that the user will not be able to read other content on the page.

Examples
--------

-   An applet displays an advertisement on a news site. The applet blinks key words in the advertisement in order to call the user's attention to it. The blinking cannot be paused through any user agent settings and the applet does not provide a mechanism to stop it.

Tests
-----

### Procedure

For each page that has blinking content in a plugin or applet:

1.  Determine if the content continues to blink for longer than 5 seconds.
2.  Determine if there is a means to pause the blinking content.

### Expected Results

-   If step \#1 is true and step \#2 is false, the content fails the success criterion.
