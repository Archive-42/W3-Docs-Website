Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to using ASCII art without providing a text alternative
==============================================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

Any technology.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content) (Failure).

Description
-----------

The objective of this failure condition is to avoid the use of [ASCII art](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#) when a text alternative is not provided. Although ASCII art is implemented as a character string, its meaning comes from the pattern of glyphs formed by a visual presentation of that string, not from the text itself. Therefore ASCII art is non-text content and requires a text alternative. Text alternatives, or links to them, should be placed near the ASCII art in order to be associated with it.

Examples
--------

### Example 1: ASCII Art chart without a text alternative

The following ASCII art chart lacks a text alternative and therefore does not meet Success Criterion 1.1.1. Note this failure example does in fact cause this page to fail, but you may [skip over the example](#F72-related-techs).

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  Access a page with ASCII art.
2.  For each instance of ASCII art, check that it has a text alternative.

### Expected Results

-   If check \#2 is false, then this failure condition applies and the content fails this Success Criterion.
