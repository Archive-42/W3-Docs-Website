Providing a button on the page to increase line spaces and paragraph spaces
===========================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

Any technology.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 1.4.8: Visual Presentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/visual-presentation) (Sufficient).

Description
-----------

Many people with cognitive disabilities have trouble reading text that is single spaced. A button that increases the line height will help them read the content. In order to retain the separation of paragraphs, the space between paragraphs should also increase so that it is at least 1.5 times as high as the line spacing.

Note

This technique can be used in combination with a style switching technique to present a page that is a [conforming alternate version](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#) for non-conforming content. Refer to [C29: Using a style switcher to provide a conforming alternate version](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/css/C29) and [Understanding Conforming Alternate Versions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#conforming-alt-versions) for more information.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

Use standard style page switching and have a button or link on the page that switches the stylesheet. The new stylesheet contains a rule to increase the line height and a class to increase the paragraph spacing.

                  p {line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 2em;}

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  Check that there is a button or link on the page that increases the size of the line height and the paragraph spacing, which is labeled as such.
2.  Activate the button or link.
3.  Check that the button or link increases the line height to at least 1.5 (150%)
4.  Check that the button or link increases the paragraph spacing at least 1.5 times greater than the line spacing.

### Expected Results

-   Checks \#1, \#3 and \#4 are true.
