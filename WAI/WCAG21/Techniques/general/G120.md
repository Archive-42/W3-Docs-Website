Providing the pronunciation immediately following the word
==========================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

All technologies.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 3.1.6: Pronunciation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pronunciation) (Sufficient).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to make the pronunciation of a word available by providing the pronunciation after the word at least the first time it occurs within a Web page.

When a Web page contains words with the same spelling but different pronunciations, this technique is not appropriate for providing the pronunciation unless it is provided for each instance.

This technique is applied to the first occurrence of an abbreviation in a Web page. When combining multiple resources into a single Web page, the abbreviation would be expanded at the beginning of each resource. In this case, however, using a different technique for providing the expanded form may be more appropriate.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

In the following example of Japanese text, the information giving the pronunciation in Han characters(Kanji) is rendered in parentheses immediately following the text.

                  <p> 慶應大学 (けいおうだいがく) </p>

### Procedure

For each word that requires pronunciation information:

2.  Check that the first use is immediately followed by the pronunciation of the word.

### Expected Results
