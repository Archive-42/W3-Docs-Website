Providing a short text alternative that describes the purpose of live audio-only and live video-only content
============================================================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

Applies to all technologies

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content) (Sufficient).

Description
-----------

This technique provides a short text alternative for Live audio-only and live video-only content. This text may be used in combination with a full text alternative for time-based media (for audio or video), or in combination with audio description (for video). Those alternatives, however, are not part of this technique. The purpose of this technique is to ensure that the user can determine what the non-text content is, even if they cannot access it. NOTE: Even if full alternatives are also available, it is important that users be able to identify the non-text content when they encounter it so that they are not confused, and so that they can associate it with the full alternative when they encounter it.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

-   A live video feed of the east coast highway has the following descriptive label "Live video picture of East Coast Highway just south of the I-81 interchange showing current traffic conditions."
-   A live audio feed of the Mississippi House of Representatives has the following descriptive label "Live audio from the microphones in the Mississippi House of Representatives."
