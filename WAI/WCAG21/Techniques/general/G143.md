Providing a text alternative that describes the purpose of the CAPTCHA
======================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

Applies to all technologies.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content) (Sufficient, together with [G144: Ensuring that the Web Page contains another CAPTCHA serving the same purpose using a different modality](../general/G144)).

Description
-----------

The purpose of this technique is to provide information via the text alternative that identifies the non-text content as a CAPTCHA. Such tests often involve asking the user to type in text that is presented in an obscured image or audio file. From the text alternative, the user can tell that the CAPTCHA requires completing a task and what type of task it is.

When an alternate version of a CAPTCHA is available, the text alternative should include instructions about how to find the alternate version.

Examples
--------

-   A CAPTCHA test asks the user to type in text that is displayed in an obscured image. The text alternative is "Type the word in the image".
-   A CAPTCHA test asks the user to type in text that is played in an audio file. The text alternative is "Type the letters spoken in the audio".
