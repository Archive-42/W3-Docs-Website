Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

All technologies that contain links

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 2.4.5: Multiple Ways](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/multiple-ways) (Sufficient when used with an unwritten technique).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to provide a list of links to all the Web pages in the set on each Web page. It is one of a series of techniques for locating content that are sufficient for addressing Success Criterion 2.4.5. This technique is only effective for small sets of Web pages; if the list of links is longer than the rest of the content in the Web page, it may make the Web page more difficult for users to understand and use.

Note

Success Criterion 2.4.1 requires a technique for skipping this list of links.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

A family Web site contains home pages for all the members of the family. Each page contains a list of links to the home pages of the other family members.

### Example 2

An electonic book is broken into separate Web pages for each chapter. Each Web page starts with a small table of contents that contains links to all the chapters in the book.
