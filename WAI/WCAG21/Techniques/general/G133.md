Providing a checkbox on the first page of a multipart form that allows users to ask for longer session time limit or no session time limit
==========================================================================================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

Content that includes multipart forms

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 2.2.1: Timing Adjustable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/timing-adjustable) (Sufficient).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to minimize the risk that users with disabilities will lose their work by providing a checkbox to request additional time to complete multipart forms. The checkbox can allow the user to request a specific amount of additional time (for example 15 minutes) or an indefinite extension. (Note that allowing an indefinite extension would be inappropriate if it jeopardized user privacy or network security.)

Examples
--------

### Example 1: A checkbox for requesting a specific extension

A Web page contains the first part of a five-part form. Immediately following the general instructions for completing the form is a checkbox with the label, “Allow an additional 15 minutes to complete each part of this form."

### Example 2: Requesting an indefinite extension

A Web page contains the first part of a three-part form. Each part of the form includes more than 10 items. Some items require users to follow links for additional information. Immediately following the general instructions for completing the form is a checkbox with the label, “Allow as much time as I need to complete this form. I understand that I must close (quit) the Web browser if I choose to stop before completing the last part of the form."

Tests
-----

### Procedure

If the Web page contains the first part of a multipart form:

1.  Check that the Web page includes a checkbox to request additional time to complete the form.
2.  Check that if the checkbox is checked, additional time is provided to complete the form.

### Expected Results

1.  All checks are true.
