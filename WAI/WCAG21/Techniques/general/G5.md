Allowing users to complete an activity without any time limit
=============================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

This technique applies to any technologies or methods supporting the implementation of an activity which does not require timed interaction for its functionality.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 2.2.3: No Timing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/no-timing) (Sufficient).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to provide users with all the time they need to complete an activity. This technique involves providing a specified activity which does not require timed interaction. Users are allowed as much time as they need to interact with the activity.

Examples
--------

-   An interactive exam for a course provides all questions on one Web page. Users can take as much time as they need to complete it.
-   In an interactive game, users can take as much time as they like on their turn instead of having to complete their move within a limited amount of time.
-   In an online auction, each bidder can submit only one bid rather than submitting multiple competitive bids based on timing. The bidding is open for a full day, providing enough time for anyone to complete the simple bid form. Once bidding is closed, the best bid wins.
