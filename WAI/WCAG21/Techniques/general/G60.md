Playing a sound that turns off automatically within three seconds
=================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

Applies to all technologies except those for voice interaction.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 1.4.2: Audio Control](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/audio-control) (Sufficient).

Description
-----------

The purpose of this technique is to allow authors to play a sound on their Web page but avoid the problem of users not being able to use their screen readers due to interference by the content sound. It also allows the author to avoid putting controls on the Web page to control the sound - and the problem faced by users with screen readers in finding the control (when unable to hear their screen reader).

The technique is simple. The sound plays for 3 or less seconds and stops automatically.

Examples
--------

-   Example 1: A Web page opens with a trumpet fanfare and then goes silent
-   Example 2: A homepage opens with the chairman saying "Binfor, where quality is our business." then going silent.
-   Example 3: A Web page opens with instructions on how to get started: "To begin, press the enter key."
-   Example 4: A Web page opens with a warning and then goes silent.
