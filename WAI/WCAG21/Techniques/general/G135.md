Using the accessibility API features of a technology to expose names and roles, to allow user-settable properties to be directly set, and to provide notification of changes

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

programming technologies that have standard components that are programmed to interface with accessibility APIs

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value) (Sufficient using a more specific technique).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to allow assistive technology to understand Web content so that it can convey equivalent information to the user through an alternate user interface.

Sometimes content is not created using markup language but rather using a programming language or tools. In many cases, these technologies have interface components that are already programmed to interface with accessibility APIs. If an author uses these components and fills in the properties (e.g., name, etc) the resulting user interface components in the content will be accessible to assistive technology.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

-   A Web page uses java to create an applet. Java swing objects (e.g., pushbutton) are used because they have accessibility properties built in that can be accessed from assistive technology written in Java and, with the Java Access Bridge, those written in other languages that use the Accessibility API of the operating system. The author fills in the values for the components and the result is accessible to AT.

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  Render content using an accessible User Agent
2.  Use an Accessibility Tool designed for the Accessibility API of the User agent to evaluate each user interface component
3.  Check that name and role for each user interface component are found by the tool.

### Expected Results

-   Step \#3 is true for each user interface component
