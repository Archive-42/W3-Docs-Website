Placing a link to the alternative for time-based media immediately next to the non-text content
===============================================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

This technique is not technology specific and can be used in any technology that supports links.

This technique relates to:

-   [Success Criterion 1.2.3: Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded) (Sufficient when used with [G69: Providing an alternative for time based media](../general/G69))
-   [Success Criterion 1.2.8: Media Alternative (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/media-alternative-prerecorded) (Sufficient when used with [G69: Providing an alternative for time based media](../general/G69))

Description
-----------

With this technique, a link to the collated document of captions and audio description is provided. The collated document could be at another location on the same Web page or at another URI. A link to the collated document is immediately adjacent to the non-text content. The link can be immediately before or after the synchronized media content. If the collated document is on the same Web page as other content then put "End of document" at the end so that they know when to stop reading and return to their previous place. If a Back button will not take the person back to the point from which they jumped, then a link back to the non-text content location is provided.

Examples
--------

### Example 1: An .MOV Document in an HTML Document

Code on a page called "Olympic\_Sports.htm"

      <a name="Olympic_Wrestling"></a>
      <p><a href="http://www.example.com/movies/olympic_wrestling.mov">Olympic Wrestling movie</a>, 
      <a href="http://www.example.com/transcripts/olympic_wrestling_transcript.htm">Olympic 
      Wrestling collated Transcript</a></p>
                

### Example 2: The link back to the .MOV Document in an HTML Document

Code on the page olympic\_wrestling\_transcript.htm

      <p>Sports announcer 1: This is a great battle tonight between England's "Will Johnson" and 
      "Theodore Derringo" from Argentina</p>
      <p>Scenery: There is a mat set out in the middle of the stadium with 500 people in the 
      stands...</p>
      <p> ...more dialogue...<p>
      <p> ...more scenery...</p>
      <p> ...etc...</p>
      <p>Sports announcer 2: And that is all for tonight, thank you for joining us tonight where 
      Will Johnson is the new Gold Medalist. 
      <a href="../movies/Olympic_Sports.htm#Olympic_Wrestling>Return to Movie page</a> </p>
