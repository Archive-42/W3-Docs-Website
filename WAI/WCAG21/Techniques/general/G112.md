Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

Any technology containing text.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 3.1.3: Unusual Words](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/unusual-words) (Sufficient using a more specific technique when used with [G101: Providing the definition of a word or phrase used in an unusual or restricted way](../general/G101)).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to provide a definition in context for any word used in an unusual or restricted way. The definition is provided in the text, either just before or just after the word is used. The definition may be included in the same sentence as the word that is being defined, or in a separate sentence.

Examples
--------

### Example 1: Ether

He believed that sound traveled through the ether, which was thought to be a substance that filled interplanetary space.

### Example 2: Driver

It may be necessary to update the driver for your printer (the driver is software that contains specific instructions for your printer).

### Example 3: W3C key words

Definition: The key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not", "should", "should not", "recommended", "may", and "optional" in this specification are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2119.html).

### Example 4: A Japanese idiomatic expression defined in context

This example uses parentheses to provide the definition of an idiomatic expression in Japanese. The phrase in Japanese says that "he throws a spoon." It means that there was nothing he can do and finally he gives up.

<span lang="jp">さじを投げる（どうすることもできなくなり、あきらめること）。</span>

Tests

### Procedure

For each word or phrase used in an unusual or restricted way:

1.  Check that the word is defined in text either before or after the first occurrence of the word.

### Expected Results

-   Check \#1 is true.
