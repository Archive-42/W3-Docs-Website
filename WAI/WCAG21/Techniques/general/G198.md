Providing a way for the user to turn the time limit off
=======================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

This technique relates to all technologies.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 2.2.1: Timing Adjustable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/timing-adjustable) (Sufficient).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism for people who cannot complete tasks within a specified time limit to turn off the time limit.

It is essential that the mechanism for turning off the time limit can be completed without a time limit itself and before the time limit for the page expires. To do this - the mechanism should be available at or near the top of the page so that it can be found and activated quickly by people with a wide range of disabilities.

Examples
--------

-   A page has a listing of news headlines that automatically update every minute. At the top of the page is a link that turns off the updating.

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  Check that there is a mechanism to turn off any time limits near the top of the page.
2.  Verify that the time limit for the page is long enough that a user can easily navigate to the mechanism even if they are 10 times slower than most users.

### Expected Results

-   Checks \#1 and \#2 are true.
