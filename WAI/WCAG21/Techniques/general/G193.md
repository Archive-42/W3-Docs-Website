Providing help by an assistant in the Web page
==============================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

All technologies.

This technique relates to:

-   [Success Criterion 3.3.5: Help](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/help) (Sufficient)
-   [Success Criterion 4.1.3: Status Messages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/status-messages) (Sufficient, together with [ARIA22: Using role=status to present status messages](../aria/ARIA22))

Description
-----------

The purpose of this technique is to provide help using a multimedia avatar that provides assistance in using the Web page. An avatar can be particularly helpful to people with cognitive disabilities who may have trouble reading text. The use of visuals will help some people to focus on the material presented.

Note

The multimedia avatar must also satisfy relevant Success Criterion in [Guideline 1.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/time-based-media).

Examples
--------

-   The home page of an online banking application has an embedded avatar named Vanna. She gives new online banking clients a tour of the features provided in the application. The assistant can be started and stopped and paused. The client can rewind and fast forward through the material. A text alternative of the information is available from a link next to the avatar.
-   A volunteer site has a welcoming page for new volunteers. In it there is an application form. On the right side of the page there an interactive multimedia file with an avatar that explains all the features and sections of the application form.
