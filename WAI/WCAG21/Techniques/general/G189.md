Providing a control near the beginning of the Web page that changes the link text
=================================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

All technologies that contain links.

This technique relates to:

-   [Success Criterion 2.4.4: Link Purpose (In Context)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context) (Sufficient when used with an unwritten technique)
-   [Success Criterion 2.4.9: Link Purpose (Link Only)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-link-only) (Sufficient when used with an unwritten technique)

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to provide the user with a control near the beginning of the page that takes the user to a conforming alternate version of the Web page where the link text alone of each link is sufficient to determine its purpose out of context.

Some users prefer to have links that are self-contained, where there is no need to explore the context of the link. Other users find including the context information in each link to be repetitive and to reduce their ability to use a site. Among users of assistive technology, the feedback to the working group on which is preferable has been divided. This technique allows users to pick the approach that works best for them. Users who need or prefer potentially longer but complete link text use this version.

If the control for switching to the alternate version is a link, it must always be possible to understand the purpose of the control directly from its link text.

This technique provides the alternate version for the current page view. It is also possible, and in some cases would be advisable, to save this preference in a cookie or server-side user profile, so that users would only have to make the selection once per site and would automatically be taken to their preferred version.

Note

This technique can be used in combination with a style switching technique to present a page that is a [conforming alternate version](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#) for non-conforming content. Refer to [C29: Using a style switcher to provide a conforming alternate version](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/css/C29) and [Understanding Conforming Alternate Versions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#conforming-alt-versions) for more information.

Examples
--------

### Example 1: Providing a Link to another Version

A Web page lists books for download in different formats. Alternate versions of the Web page use just the book format as the link text or the book title and format type.

Version with short link text:

                  ...
                    <h1>Books for download</h1>
                    <p><a href="books-full-links.html" >Full link Version</a></p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>The History of the Web: 
                    <a href="history.docx" class="hist">Word</a>, 
                    <a href="history.pdf" class="hist">PDF</a>, 
                    <a href="history.html" class="hist">HTML</a>
                    </li>
                    ...
                    </ul>
                

Version with full link text:

                  ...
                    <h1>Books for download</h1>
                    <p><a href="books-short-links.html" >Short link Version</a></p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>The History of the Web: 
                    <a href="history.docx" class="hist">The History of the Web(Word)</a>, 
                    <a href="history.pdf" class="hist">The History of the Web(PDF)>/a>, 
                    <a href="history.html" class="hist">The History of the Web(HTML)</a>
                    </li>
                    ...
                    </ul>
