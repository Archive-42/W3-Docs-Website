Providing link text that describes the purpose of a link
========================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

All technologies that contain links.

This technique relates to:

-   [Success Criterion 2.4.4: Link Purpose (In Context)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context) (Sufficient)
-   [Success Criterion 2.4.4: Link Purpose (In Context)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context) (Sufficient using a more specific technique)
-   [Success Criterion 2.4.9: Link Purpose (Link Only)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-link-only) (Sufficient)

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to describe the purpose of a link in the text of the link. The description lets a user distinguish this link from links in the Web page that lead to other destinations and helps the user determine whether to follow the link. The URI of the destination is generally not sufficiently descriptive.

Examples
--------

### Example 1: Describing the purpose of a link in HTML in the text content of the a element

                  <a href="routes.html">
                    Current routes at Boulders Climbing Gym
                    </a>
