Providing keyboard-triggered event handlers
===========================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

Applies to all technologies where content includes functionality.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 2.1.1: Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard) (Sufficient using a more specific technique).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to permit individuals who rely on a keyboard or keyboard interface to access the functionality of the content. To do this, make sure that all event handlers triggered by non-keyboard UI events are also associated with a keyboard-based event, or provide redundant keyboard-based mechanisms to accomplish the functionality provided by other device-specific functions.

Examples
--------

-   **Example 1: A drag and drop feature** A photo application includes a "drag" and "drop" feature to allow users to re-order photographs in an on-line album for presentation as a slide show. It also includes a feature that allows users to select a photo and 'cut' and 'paste' the items into the list at the appropriate point using only the keyboard.
-   **Example 2: A reorder feature** A Web application that allows users to create surveys by dragging questions into position includes a list of the questions followed by a text field that allows users to re-order questions as needed by entering the desired question number.
