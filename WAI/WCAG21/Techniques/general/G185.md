Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

All technologies that contain links.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 2.4.5: Multiple Ways](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/multiple-ways) (Sufficient when used with an unwritten technique).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to make it possible for users to locate all the information in a small Web site by providing links to all Web pages from the home page. When the number of pages in the site is small enough, the home page can contain site map information directly. The other pages in the Web site contain links to the home page.

In this way, the home page serves as two mechanisms in one. It provides the usual navigation to pages. It also is a de facto site map to the site.

All the Web pages in the site may contain links to all the other pages, and those sets of links satisfy [Success Criterion 3.2.3 (Consistent Navigation)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/consistent-navigation).

Examples
--------

-   A small commercial Web site for a consultant contains a home page, a Contacts page for contacting the consultant, a page describing the consultant's background, and a page with examples of the consultant's work. Each page contains a navigation bar that links to all the other pages in the site.
