Providing a mechanism to remove full justification of text
==========================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

All technologies.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 1.4.8: Visual Presentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/visual-presentation) (Sufficient).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to provide a version of the page that does not have full justification (justified both left and right).

There may be circumstances when for layout purposes an author may want to have the text fully justified. In these cases, it is sufficient to provide a feature that removes the justification of text. The control should be easy to find and access and near the beginning of the page.

Note

This technique can be used in combination with a style switching technique to present a page that is a [conforming alternate version](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#) for non-conforming content. Refer to [C29: Using a style switcher to provide a conforming alternate version](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/css/C29) and [Understanding Conforming Alternate Versions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#conforming-alt-versions) for more information.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

A classic novel online is on a site that attempts to duplicate the look of the originally published work, which includes full justification. A button is provided near the top of the page saying "remove full justification" and a style switching technique is used to swap out the style sheet. The new style sheet aligns the text only on the left.

Tests

### Procedure

1.  Open a page with full justification.
2.  Check that there is a feature to remove the full justification.
3.  Check that the feature removes the full justification.

### Expected Results

-   Checks \#2 and \#3 are true.
