Ensuring that the Web Page contains another CAPTCHA serving the same purpose using a different modality
=======================================================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

Applies to all technologies.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content) (Sufficient, together with [G143: Providing a text alternative that describes the purpose of the CAPTCHA](../general/G143)).

Description
-----------

The purpose of this technique is to reduce occasions in which a user with a disability cannot complete a CAPTCHA task. Because there are alternate CAPTCHA tasks that use different modalities, a user is more likely to be able to complete one of the tasks successfully.

Examples
--------

-   A Web page that includes a CAPTCHA test that must be completed successfully before the user can advance to the next step in a process. The page includes both a visual task, such as typing words displayed in a image, and an audio task, such as typing letters spoken in an audio file. A user with hearing disabilities who cannot pass the audio CAPTCHA may be able to pass the visual CAPTCHA.
-   A blog comment form includes a visual CAPTCHA that must be completed before a user can submit comments. In addition to the visual CAPTCHA, it includes a CAPTCHA with a form field that asks, "What is two plus seven?" with a text entry field that allows users to enter the correct answer.
