Fully conforming to specifications
==================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

This technique relates to all markup languages with specifications.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 4.1.1: Parsing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/parsing) (Sufficient).

Description
-----------

When markup languages are used in a way that fully conforms to their specifications, all of the requirements in 4.1.1 are met. Therefore, while fully conforming to specifications is not required to conform to WCAG 2.0, it is a best practice and is sufficient to meet Success Criterion 4.1.1.

Examples
--------

-   A page is created with care to make sure that all technologies are used according to specification. It is run through a validator and all identified errors are corrected. Specification requirements that can not be identified by validation are also checked and any failures are corrected.

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  Check that all technologies are used according to specification.

Note

While validators can be great tools for catching errors, they usually cannot catch all cases where content fails to fully conform to a specification.

### Expected Results

-   Check \#1 is true.
