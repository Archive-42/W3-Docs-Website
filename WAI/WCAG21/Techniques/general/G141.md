Organizing a page using headings
================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

Pages with content organized into sections.

This technique relates to:

-   [Success Criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships) (Advisory)
-   [Success Criterion 2.4.10: Section Headings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/section-headings) (Sufficient)

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to ensure that sections have headings that identify them. Success Criterion 1.3.1 requires that the headings be marked such that they can be programmatically identified.

In HTML, this could be done using the HTML heading elements (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6). These allow user agents to automatically identify section headings. Other technologies use other techniques for identifying headers. To facilitate navigation and understanding of overall document structure, authors should use headings that are properly nested (e.g., h1 followed by h2, h2 followed by h2 or h3, h3 followed by h3 or h4, etc.).

Examples
--------

### Example 1: Headings used to organize an HTML page

A page on cooking techniques uses a h1 element for the overall title, and h2 elements for major sections on cooking with oil vs cooking with butter, and h3 elements for sub-sections on oil-cooking techniques.

                  <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
                    <head>
                    <title>Cooking techniques</title>
                    </head>
                    <body>
                    <h1>Cooking techniques</h1>
                    ... some text here ...
                    <h2>Cooking with oil</h2>
                    ... text of the section ...
                    <h3>Saut√©eing</h3>
                    ...
                    <h3>Deep frying</h3>
                    <h2>Cooking with butter</h2>
                    ... text of the section ...
                    </body>
                  </html>
