Using an instant client-side redirect
=====================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

Applies to all technologies.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 3.2.5: Change on Request](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/change-on-request) (Sufficient using a more specific technique).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to enable redirects on the client side without confusing the user. Redirects are preferably implemented on the server side (see [SVR1: Implementing automatic redirects on the server side instead of on the client side](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/server-side-script/SVR1)), because a server-side redirect does not cause new content to be displayed before the server sends the content located at the new URI. However, authors do not always have control over server-side technologies; in that case, they can use a client-side redirect. A client-side redirect is implemented by code inside the content that instructs the user agent to retrieve content from a different URI. It is important that the redirecting page or Web page only contains information related to the redirect.

Examples
--------

### Example 1: HTML: meta Refresh With a URI and No Timeout

In HTML 4.x and XHTML 1.x, it is possible to implement a client-side redirect using the meta element: see [H76: Using meta refresh to create an instant client-side redirect](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H76).

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  Find each link or programmatic reference to another page or Web page.
2.  For each link or programmatic reference, check if the referenced Web page contains code (e.g., meta element or script) that causes a client-side redirect.
3.  For each link or programmatic reference that causes a client-side redirect, check if the redirect is implemented without a time limit or delay and that the page only contains information related to the redirect.

### Expected Results

Step 2 is false or step 3 is true.
