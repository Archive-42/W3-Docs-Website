Providing a short text alternative which is the accepted name or a descriptive name of the non-text content
===========================================================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

All technologies

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content) (Sufficient).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to allow users to identify the non-text content even if the non-text content is intended to provide a specific sensory experience. For example, a deaf person may want to know what an audio instrumental file is - even if they cannot hear it. Similarly, a blind person may want to know what the subject of a visual image is - even if they cannot see it.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

-   A painting of the Mona Lisa has an alternate text of "Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci".
-   A sound file has an alternate text of "5 Grade children playing a Theramin".
-   A famous modern art piece is labeled "Red, Blue and Yellow, by Piet Mondrian".
