Providing a submit button to initiate a change of context
=========================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

Content that includes forms.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 3.2.2: On Input](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/on-input) (Sufficient using a more specific technique).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism that allows users to explicitly request changes of context. Since the intended use of a submit button is to generate an HTTP request that submits data entered in a form, this is an appropriate control to use for causing a change of context and is a practice that does not create confusion for users.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

Example 1: A submit button is used for each form that causes a change in context.
