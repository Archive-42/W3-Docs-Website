Providing a title using the title element
=========================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML and XHTML

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 2.4.2: Page Titled](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/page-titled) (Sufficient when used with [G88: Providing descriptive titles for Web pages](../general/G88)).

Description
-----------

All HTML and XHTML documents, including those in individual frames in a frameset, have a `title` element in the `head` section that defines in a simple phrase the purpose of the document. This helps users to orient themselves within the site quickly without having to search for orientation information in the body of the page.

Note that the (mandatory) `title` element, which only appears once in a document, is different from the `title` attribute, which may be applied to almost every HTML and XHTML element.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

This example defines a document's title.

    <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">   
       <head>     
          <title>The World Wide Web Consortium</title>     
       </head>   
       <body>     
          ...   
       </body> 
    </html>

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  Examine the source code of the HTML or XHTML document and check that a non-empty `title` element appears in the `head` section.
2.  Check that the `title` element describes the document.

### Expected Results

-   Checks 1 and 2 are true.

Test Rules
----------

The following are Test Rules related to this Technique. It is not necessary to use these particular Test Rules to check for conformance with WCAG, but they are defined and approved test methods.
