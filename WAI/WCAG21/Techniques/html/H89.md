Using the title attribute to provide context-sensitive help
===========================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML and XHTML

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 3.3.5: Help](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/help) (Advisory).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to provide context sensitive help for users as they enter data in forms by providing the help information in a `title` attribute. The help may include format information or examples of input.

Note

Current user agents and assistive technologies do not always provide the information contained in the `title` attribute to users. Avoid using this technique in isolation until the `title` attribute has wide-spread support.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

A mapping application provides a form consisting of a label "Address:", an input box and a submit button with value "Find map". The input box has a `title` attribute value with an example of the address format the user should enter.

    <label for="searchAddress">Address: </label>
    <input id="searchAddress" type="text" size="30" value="" name="searchAddress" 
     title="Address example: 101 Collins St, Melbourne, Australia" />
                 

### Example 2

A form that allows users to pay their bill online requires the user to enter their account number. The input box associated with the "Account number" label has a `title` attribute providing information on locating the account number.

    <label for="accNum1">Account number: </label>
    <input id="accNum1" type="text" size="10" value="" title="Your account number 
     can be found in the top right-hand corner of your bill." />

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  Identify form controls that require text input.
2.  Check that each form control has an explicitly associated label
3.  Check that each form control has context-sensitive help provided in the `title` attribute.

### Expected Results

-   Checks \#2 and \#3 are true.
