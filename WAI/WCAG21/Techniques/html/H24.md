Providing text alternatives for the `area` elements of image maps
=================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML and XHTML Documents that contain `area` elements.

This technique relates to:

-   [Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content) (Sufficient)
-   [Success Criterion 2.4.4: Link Purpose (In Context)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context) (Sufficient)
-   [Success Criterion 2.4.9: Link Purpose (Link Only)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-link-only) (Sufficient)

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to provide text alternatives that serve the same purpose as the selectable regions of an image map. An image map is an image divided into selectable regions defined by `area` elements. Each area is a link to another Web page or another part of the current Web page. The `alt` attribute of each `area` element serves the same purpose as the selectable area of the image.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

This example uses the `alt` attribute of the `area` element to provide text that describes the purpose of the image map areas.

    <img src="welcome.gif" usemap="#map1" 
        alt="Areas in the library. Select an area for
    more information on that area." /> 
    <map id="map1" name="map1">
      <area shape="rect" coords="0,0,30,30"
        href="reference.html" alt="Reference" />
      <area shape="rect" coords="34,34,100,100"
        href="media.html" alt="Audio visual lab" />
    </map>

Tests
-----

### Procedure

For each `area` element in an image map:

1.  Check that the `area` element has an `alt` attribute.
2.  Check that the text alternative specified by the `alt` attribute serves the same purpose as the part of image map image referenced by the `area` element of the imagemap.

### Expected Results

-   The above checks are true.
