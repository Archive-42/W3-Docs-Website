Using the scope attribute to associate header cells and data cells in data tables
=================================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML and XHTML

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships) (Sufficient when used with an unwritten technique).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to associate header cells with data cells in complex tables using the `scope` attribute. The `scope` attribute may be used to clarify the scope of any cell used as a header. The scope identifies whether the cell is a header for a row, column, or group of rows or columns. The values row, col, rowgroup, and colgroup identify these possible scopes respectively.

For simple data tables where the header is not in the first row or column, like the one in Example 1, this technique can be used. Based on screen reader support today, its use is suggested in two situations both relating to simple tables:

-   data cells marked up with `td` that also function as row header or column header
-   header cells marked up with `td` instead of `th`. Sometimes, authors use this to avoid the display characteristics associated with `th` and also do not choose to use CSS to control the display for `th`.

Note

For simple tables that have the headers in the first row or column then it is sufficient to simply use the TH elements without scope.

For complex tables use ids and headers as in [](#H43).

Some users may find it easier to work with several simple tables than one more complex table. Authors may wish to consider whether they can convert complex tables to one or more simple tables.

Examples
--------

### Example 1: A simple schedule

In the following example, column \#1 contains serial numbers for rows in the table and the second column contains the key value for the row. The cells in the second column may then use `scope`="row". The cells in the first row too are marked up with `td` and use `scope`="col".

     <table border="1">
      <caption>Contact Information</caption>
      <tr>
        <td></td>
        <th scope="col">Name</th>
        <th scope="col">Phone#</th>
        <th scope="col">Fax#</th>
        <th scope="col">City</th>
      </tr><tr>
        <td>1.</td>
        <th scope="row">Joel Garner</th>
        <td>412-212-5421</td>
        <td>412-212-5400</td>
        <td>Pittsburgh</td>
      </tr><tr>
        <td>2.</td>
        <th scope="row">Clive Lloyd</th>
        <td>410-306-1420</td>
        <td>410-306-5400</td>
        <td>Baltimore</td>
      </tr><tr>
        <td>3.</td>
        <th scope="row">Gordon Greenidge</th>
        <td>281-564-6720</td>
        <td>281-511-6600</td>
        <td>Houston</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

Tests

### Procedure

For each data table:

1.  Check that all `th` elements have a `scope` attribute.
2.  Check that all `td` elements that act as headers for other elements have a `scope` attribute.
3.  Check that all `scope` attributes have the value row, col, rowgroup, or colgroup.

### Expected Results

-   All checks above are true.
