Providing heading elements at the beginning of each section of content

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML and XHTML

This technique relates to:

-   [Success Criterion 2.4.1: Bypass Blocks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/bypass-blocks) (Sufficient when used with an unwritten technique)
-   [Success Criterion 2.4.10: Section Headings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/section-headings) (Sufficient)

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to use section headings to convey the structure of the content. Heading markup can be used:

-   to indicate start of main content
-   to mark up section headings within the main content area
-   to demarcate different navigational sections like top or main navigation, left or secondary navigation and footer navigation
-   to mark up images of text that are used as headings
-   to allow users the ability to navigate a page by sections or skip repeated blocks of information

Headings are designed to convey logical hierarchy. Skipping levels in the sequence of headings may create the impression that the structure of the document has not been properly thought through or that specific headings have been chosen for their visual rendering rather than their meaning. Authors are encouraged to nest headings hierarchically. When headings are nested hierarchically, the most important information is given the highest logical level, and subsections are given subsequent logical levels.(i.e., h2 is a subsection of h1). Providing this type of structure will help users understand the overall organization of the content more easily.

Since headings indicate the start of important sections of content, it is possible for users with assistive technology to jump directly to the appropriate heading and begin reading the content. This significantly speeds interaction for users who would otherwise access the content slowly. Headings create chunks of information that can be found easily by people with disabilities, such as a blind person using a screen reader, or a person with a cognitive disability who uses assistive technology that delineates groups of information, or someone with a communication disability or illiteracy, who uses a screen reader to assist them in their reading.

Note

All of our techniques assume that people needing special user agents (including AT or special plug-ins) will get and be using that type user agent (eg screen reader, or plug-in that allows keyboard navigation of properly marked up content, etc).

Examples
--------

### Example 1

This example organizes the sections of a search page by marking each section heading using `h2` elements.

    <h1>Search Technical Periodicals</h1>
     <h2>Search</h2>
     <form action="search.php">
      <p><label for="searchInput">Enter search topic: </label>
      <input type="text" size="30" id="searchInput">
      <input type="submit" value="Go"></p>
     </form>
     <h2>Available Periodicals</h2>
     <div class="jlinks">
      <a href="pcoder.com">Professional Coder</a> |
      <a href="algo.com">Algorithms</a> |
      <a href="jse.com">Journal of Software Engineering</a>
     </div>
     <h2>Search Results</h2>
     ... search results are returned in this section ...   

### Example 2: Headings show the overall organization of the content

In this example, heading markup is used to make the navigation and main content sections perceivable.

    <!-- Logo, banner graphic, search form, etc.  -->
      <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="about.htm">About us</a></li>
          <li><a href="contact.htm">Contact us</a></li>
           ...
        </ul>
      <h2>All about headings</h2>
       <!-- Text, images, other material making up the main content... --> 
                

### Example 3: Headings show the organization of material within the main content

Note that in HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.x, heading elements only mark the beginning of sections. Because there is no markup to associate a heading element with the section content explicitly, users will assume that the heading applies to all following content until the next heading element is encountered.

     <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <head>
        <title>Cooking techniques</title>  
      </head>   
      <body>     
        <h1>Cooking techniques</h1>     
        <p>       
          ... some text here ...     
        </p>           
        <h2>Cooking with oil</h2> 
        <p> 
            ... text of the section ...     
        </p>           
        <h2>Cooking with butter</h2>       
        <p>
            ... text of the section ...     
        </p>   
      </body> 
    </html>

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  Check that the content is divided into separate sections
2.  Check that each section on the page starts with a heading.

### Expected Results

-   For 2.4.1 check \#2 is true.
-   For 2.4.10 checks \#1 and \#2 are true.
