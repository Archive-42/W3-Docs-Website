Using description lists
=======================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML and XHTML

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 3.1.3: Unusual Words](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/unusual-words) (Sufficient when used with [G55: Linking to definitions](../general/G55)).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to provide the description of names or terms by presenting them in a description list. The list is marked up using the `dl` element. Within the list, each term is put in a separate `dt` element, and its description goes in the `dd` element directly following it. Multiple terms can be associated with a single description, as can a single term with multiple descriptions, provided that semantic sequence is maintained. The `title` attribute can be used to provide additional information about the description list. Usage of description lists ensures that terms and their descriptions are semantically related even as presentation format changes, as well as ensuring that these terms and descriptions are semantically grouped as a unit.

Description lists are easiest to use when the descriptions are ordered alphabetically. A common use for description lists is a glossary of terms.

Note

In HTML5 the name "Description list" was introduced. In previous versions these lists were referred to as "Definition lists".

Examples
--------

### Example 1

A list of descriptions of nautical terms used on a Website about sailing.

    <dl title="Nautical terms">
      <dt>Knot</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>A <em>knot</em> is a unit of speed equaling 1 
          nautical mile per hour (1.15 miles per hour or 1.852 
          kilometers per hour).</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Port</dt>
      <dd>
        <p><em>Port</em> is the nautical term (used on 
          boats and ships) that refers to the left side
          of a ship, as perceived by a person facing towards 
          the bow (the front of the vessel).</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Starboard</dt>
      <dd>
        <p><em>Starboard</em> is the nautical term (used 
          on boats and ships) that refers to the right 
          side of a vessel, as perceived by a person 
          facing towards the bow (the front of the vessel).</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

Tests

### Procedure

For any set of terms and their associated descriptions:

1.  Check that the list is contained within a `dl` element.
2.  Check that each term in the list being described is contained within a `dt` element.
3.  Check that when there is more than one term that shares the same decription that the `dt` elements immediately follow each other.
4.  Check that the description for each term is contained in one or more `dd` elements.
5.  Check that the one or more `dd` elements immediately follow the one or more `dt` elements containing the term being described.

### Expected Results

-   All checks above are true.
