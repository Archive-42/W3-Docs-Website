Providing text alternatives on `applet` elements
================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML and XHTML Documents that load Java applets where `applet` is not deprecated.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content) (Sufficient).

Description
-----------

Provide a text alternative for an applet by using the `alt` attribute to label an applet and providing the text alternative in the body of the applet element. In this technique, both mechanisms are required due to the varying support of the `alt` attribute and applet body text by user agents.

Examples
--------

### Example 1: An applet to play the tic-tac-toe game.

    <applet code="tictactoe.class" width="250" height="250" alt="tic-tac-toe game">
       tic-tac-toe game
    </applet>

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  View the source code of the applet element
2.  Check that the applet element contains an `alt` attribute with a text alternative for the applet
3.  Check that the applet element contains a text alternative for the applet in the body of the applet element

### Expected Results

-   Checks \#2 and \#3 are true.
