Providing definitions for abbreviations by using the abbr element
=================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML and XHTML

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 3.1.4: Abbreviations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/abbreviations) (Sufficient when used with [G102: Providing the expansion or explanation of an abbreviation](../general/G102)).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to provide expansions or definitions for abbreviations by using the `abbr` element

It is always appropriate to use the `abbr` element for any abbreviation, including acronyms and initialisms. When using HTML 4 and XHTML, initialisms and acronyms may be marked up using the `acronym` element. In HTML5 and newer versions of HTML the `acronym` element was marked as obsolete in favor of the more general `abbr` element.

Examples
--------

### Example 1: Using `abbr` element to expand abbreviations.

    <p>Sugar is commonly sold in 5 <abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr> bags.</p>
    <p>Welcome to the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>!</p>              

### Example 2: Using `abbr` element to define abbreviations.

    <p>Tasini <abbr title="and others">et al.</abbr> <abbr title="versus">v.</abbr>
    The New York Times <abbr title="and others">et al.</abbr> is the landmark lawsuit 
    brought by members of the National Writers Union against ......</p>  

### Example 3: Using the `abbr` element to expand an acronym

     <p>The use of <abbr title="Keep It Simple Stupid">KISS</abbr> became popular in ...</p>        
                

### Example 4: Using the `abbr` element to expand an initialism

     <p><abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr></p>
