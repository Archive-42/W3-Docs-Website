Using the `title` attribute of the `frame` and `iframe` elements
================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML and XHTML documents that use frames or iframes

This technique relates to:

-   [Success Criterion 2.4.1: Bypass Blocks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/bypass-blocks) (Sufficient, together with [H70: Using frame elements to group blocks of repeated material](../html/H70) when used with an unwritten technique)
-   [Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value) (Sufficient when used with [G108: Using markup features to expose the name and role, allow user-settable properties to be directly set, and provide notification of changes](../general/G108))

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to demonstrate the use of the `title` attribute of the `frame` or `iframe` element to describe the contents of each frame. This provides a label for the frame so users can determine which frame to enter and explore in detail. It does not label the individual page (frame) or inline frame (iframe) in the frameset.

Note that the `title` attribute labels frames, and is different from the `title` element which labels documents. Both should be provided, since the first facilitates navigation among frames and the second clarifies the user's current location.

The `title` attribute is not interchangeable with the `name` attribute. The `title` labels the frame for users; the `name` labels it for scripting and window targeting. The `name` is not presented to the user, only the `title` is.

In HTML5 the `frame` element is marked as obsolete. The `iframe` element remains part of the HTML5 specification.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

This example shows how to use the `title` attribute with `frame` to describe the frames containing the navigation bar and the document.

    <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <head>
        <title>A simple frameset document</title>
      </head>
      <frameset cols="10%, 90%">
        <frame src="nav.html" title="Main menu" />
        <frame src="doc.html" title="Documents" />
        <noframes>
          <body>
            <a href="lib.html" title="Library link">Select to
            go to the electronic library</a>
          </body>
        </noframes>
      </frameset>
    </html> 

### Example 2

This example shows how to use the title attribute with `iframe` to describe the contents of an inline frame. The example also includes an alternative link to the page included by the iframe element for older browsers, which may not understand the `iframe`element.

     <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <head>
        <title>A document using iframe</title>
      </head>
    ...
    <iframe src="banner-ad.html" id="testiframe" 
      name="testiframe" title="Advertisement">
        <a href="banner-ad.html">Advertisement</a>
    </iframe>
    ...
    </html>

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  Check each frame and iframe element in the HTML or XHTML source code for the presence of a title attribute.
2.  Check that the title attribute contains text that identifies the frame.

### Expected Results

-   Checks \#1 and \#2 are true.
