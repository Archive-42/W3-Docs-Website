Using meta refresh to create an instant client-side redirect
============================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML and XHTML

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 3.2.5: Change on Request](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/change-on-request) (Sufficient when used with [G110: Using an instant client-side redirect](../general/G110)).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to enable redirects on the client side without confusing the user. Redirects are preferably implemented on the server side (see [SVR1: Implementing automatic redirects on the server side instead of on the client side](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/server-side-script/SVR1)), but authors do not always have control over server-side technologies.

In HTML and XHTML, one can use the `meta` element with the value of the `http-equiv` attribute set to "Refresh" and the value of the `content` attribute set to "0" (meaning zero seconds), followed by the URI that the browser should request. It is important that the time-out is set to zero, to avoid that content is displayed before the new page is loaded. The page containing the redirect code should only contain information related to the redirect.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

     <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">    
      <head>      
        <title>The Tudors</title>      
        <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL='http://thetudors.example.com/'" />    
      </head>    
      <body> 
        <p>This page has moved to a <a href="http://thetudors.example.com/">
          theTudors.example.com</a>.</p> 
      </body>  
    </html>

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  Find all `meta` elements in the document.
2.  For each meta element, check if it contains the attribute `http-equiv` with value "refresh" (case-insensitive) and the `content` attribute with a number greater than 0 followed by ;'URL=anyURL' (where anyURL stands for the URI that should replace the current page).

### Expected Results

Step 2 is false.
