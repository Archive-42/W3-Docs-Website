Using caption elements to associate data table captions with data tables
========================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML data tables

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships) (Sufficient when used with an unwritten technique).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to programmatically associate captions for data tables where captions are provided in the presentation. The caption for a table is a table identifier and acts like a title or heading for the table.

The `caption` element is the appropriate markup for such text and it ensures that the table identifier remains associated with the table, including visually (by default). In addition, using the `caption` element allows screen reading software to navigate directly to the caption for a table if one is present.

Note

Although WCAG 2.0 does not prohibit the use of layout tables, CSS-based layouts are recommended in order to retain the defined semantic meaning of the HTML `table` elements and to conform to the coding practice of separating presentation from content. If a table is used for layout, the `caption` element is not used. The purpose of a layout table is simply to control the placement of content; the table itself is â€œtransparent" to the user. A `caption` would "break" this transparency by calling attention to the table. See [F46: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 due to using th elements, layout tables](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/failures/F46) for details..

Examples
--------

### Example 1: An appointment calendar with a `caption`

    <table>
    <caption>Schedule for the week of March 6</caption>
    ...</table>

Tests
-----

### Procedure

For each data table:

1.  Check that the table has content that is presented as a table caption.
2.  Check that the table includes a `caption` element.
3.  Check that the content of the `caption` element identifies the table.

### Expected Results

-   \#1-3 are true.
