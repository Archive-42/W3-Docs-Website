Using the language attribute on the `HTML` element
==================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 3.1.1: Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/language-of-page) (Sufficient).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to identify the default language of a document by providing the `lang` attribute on the `html` element.

Identifying the language of the document is important for a number of reasons:

-   It allows braille translation software to substitute control codes for accented characters, and insert control codes necessary to prevent erroneous creation of Grade 2 braille contractions.
-   Speech synthesizers that support multiple languages will be able to orient and adapt to the pronunciation and syntax that are specific to the language of the page, speaking the text in the appropriate accent with proper pronunciation.
-   Marking the language can benefit future developments in technology, for example users who are unable to translate between languages themselves will be able to use machines to translate unfamiliar languages.
-   Marking the language can also assist user agents in providing definitions using a dictionary.

HTML uses the `lang` attribute of the `html` element.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

This example defines the content of an HTML document to be in the French language.

    <!DOCTYPE>
    <html lang="fr"> 
    <head>
      <title>document écrit en français</title>
      <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
    </head>  
    <body>     
        ...document écrit en français...   
    </body>
    </html>

Tests
-----

### Procedure

Examine the `html` element of the document.

1.  Check that the `html` element has a `lang` attribute.
2.  Check that the value of the `lang` attribute conforms to [BCP 47: Tags for the Identification of Languages](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) or its successor and reflects the primary language used by the Web page.

### Expected Results

-   Checks \#1 and \#2 are true.

Test Rules
----------

The following are Test Rules related to this Technique. It is not necessary to use these particular Test Rules to check for conformance with WCAG, but they are defined and approved test methods.
