Using id and headers attributes to associate data cells with header cells in data tables
========================================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML and XHTML

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships) (Sufficient when used with an unwritten technique).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to associate each data cell (in a data table) with the appropriate headers. This technique adds a `headers` attribute to each data cell (`td` element). It also adds an `id` attribute to any cell used as a header for other cells. The `headers` attribute of a cell contains a list of the `id` attributes of the associated header cells. If there is more than one `id`, they are separated by spaces.

This technique is used when data cells are associated with more than one row and/or one column header. This allows screen readers to speak the headers associated with each data cell when the relationships are too complex to be identified using the `th` element alone or the `th` element with the `scope` attribute. Using this technique also makes these complex relationships perceivable when the presentation format changes.

This technique is not recommended for layout tables since its use implies a relationship between cells that is not meaningful when tables are used for layout.

Examples
--------

### Example 1: A table with multiple rows of headers

    <table>
       <tr>
         <th rowspan="2" id="h">Homework</th>
         <th colspan="3" id="e">Exams</th>
         <th colspan="3" id="p">Projects</th>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <th id="e1" headers="e">1</th>
         <th id="e2" headers="e">2</th>
         <th id="ef" headers="e">Final</th>
         <th id="p1" headers="p">1</th>
         <th id="p2" headers="p">2</th>
         <th id="pf" headers="p">Final</th>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td headers="h">15%</td>
        <td headers="e e1">15%</td>
        <td headers="e e2">15%</td>
        <td headers="e ef">20%</td>
        <td headers="p p1">10%</td>
        <td headers="p p2">10%</td>
        <td headers="p pf">15%</td>
       </tr>
      </table>

Tests

### Procedure

1.  Check for layout tables: determine whether the content has a relationship with other content in both its column and its row. If “no," the table is a layout table. If “yes," the table is a data table.
2.  For data tables, check that any cell that is associated with more than one row and/or one column header contains a `headers` attribute that lists the `id` for all headers associated with that cell.
3.  For data tables where any cell contains an `id` or `headers` attribute,

    1.  Check that each `id` listed in the `headers` attribute of the data cell matches the `id` attribute of a cell that is used as a header element
    2.  Check that the `headers` attribute of a data cell contains the `id` attribute of all headers associated with the data cell
    3.  Check that all ids are unique (that is, no two elements in the page have the same id)

### Expected Results

-   If table is a layout table, no cells contain `headers` or `id` attributes
-   If table is a data table and any cell contains an `id` attribute, checks \#3.a, \#3.b, and \#3.c are true.
-   If table is a data table and any cell is associated with more than one row and/or one column header, check \#2 is true.
