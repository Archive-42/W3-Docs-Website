Using `noembed` with `embed`
============================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

Documents that load plugins with the `embed` element.

This technique relates to:

-   [Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content) (Advisory)
-   [Success Criterion 1.2.8: Media Alternative (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/media-alternative-prerecorded) (Advisory)

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to provide alternative content for the `embed` element in a `noembed` element. The `noembed` is rendered only if the `embed` is not supported. While it can be positioned anywhere on the page, it is a good idea to include it as a child element of `embed` so that it is clear to assistive technologies that a text alternative is associated with the `embed` element it describes.

Examples
--------

### Example 1: `noembed` is provided inside an `embed`

    <embed src="../movies/history_of_rome.mov"
      height="60" width="144" autostart="false">
      <noembed>
        <a href="../transcripts/transcript_history_rome.htm">Transcript of "The history of Rome"</a>
      </noembed>
    </embed>

### Example 2: `noembed` is provided beside an `embed`

    <embed src="moviename.swf" width="100" height="80"
      pluginspage="http://example.com/shockwave/download/" />
    <noembed>
      <img alt="Still from Movie" src="moviename.gif" 
        width="100" height="80" />
    </noembed>;

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  Check if `embed` element has a child `noembed` element
2.  Check if `embed` element has a `noembed` element that immediately follows it.

### Expected Results

-   \#1 is true or \#2 is true
