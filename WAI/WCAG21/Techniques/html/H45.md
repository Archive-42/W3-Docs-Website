Using longdesc
==============

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML and XHTML documents that include images that cannot be described in a short text alternative.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content) (Sufficient).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to provide information in a file designated by the `longdesc` attribute when a short text alternative does not adequately convey the function or information provided in the image. The `longdesc` attribute is a URI, the target of which contains a long description of the non-text content.

Authors can provide a description for an image by including text in a separate resource or within the text of the page containing the image. An advantage of using a separate resource for the description is that it is easily reusable for multiple instances of the same image, it does not add on-page visual clutter to the original document, and the description's end-point is apparent to the user. An advantage of providing the description within the same page as the image is that all users can access the description. A limitation of the on-page method, as well as in providing multiple descriptions on a single separate page, is that current implementations supporting longdesc do not identify the long description's end-point. Authors can solve this by providing a well-formed description, which identifies the where the description ends.

Examples
--------

### Example 1: Using longdesc to refer to a long description contained on a separate resource.

    <p><img src="chart.gif" alt="a complex chart" longdesc="chartdesc.html"/></p>

### Example 2: Using longdesc to refer to a long description within the same page.

    <img longdesc="thispage.html#desc" alt="Line graph of the number of subscribers" src="http://www.company/images/graph.png">
    <div id="desc">
    <h3>Long Description: Line graph of the number of subscribers</h3>
    <!-- Full Description of Graph -->
    <p>Long description ends.</p>
    <div>

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  Check that the `img` element has a longdesc attribute.
2.  Check that the value of the `longdesc` attribute is a valid URI of an existing resource.
3.  Check that the content at the target of that URI contains a long description describing the original non-text content associated with it.

### Expected Results

-   \#1 through \#3 are all true
