Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML and XHTML

This technique relates to:

-   [Success Criterion 3.1.3: Unusual Words](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/unusual-words) (Sufficient when used with [G55: Linking to definitions](../general/G55))
-   [Success Criterion 3.1.4: Abbreviations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/abbreviations) (Sufficient when used with [G102: Providing the expansion or explanation of an abbreviation](../general/G102))

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism for locating a glossary. When terms in the content are defined on a separate glossary page, the glossary is referenced using a `link` element in the `head` element of the document that uses the glossary. The `rel` attribute of the `link` element is set to "glossary", and the `href` attribute contains the URI of the glossary page. User agents can then assist users in accessing the glossary quickly and easily.

Examples
--------

### Example 1: The WCAG 2.0 Glossary.

     <link rel="glossary" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#glossary">

Resources

Tests

### Procedure

For any set of words and their definitions that are meant to serve as a glossary:

1.  Check that the `head` section of the Web page that contains words, phrases or abbreviations defined in a glossary contains a `link` element
2.  Check that the `link` element has attribute `rel`="glossary"
3.  Check that the `href` attribute of the `link` element refers to the glossary page.

### Expected Results

-   All checks above are true.

Note: The definition of abbreviation used in WCAG is : "shortened form of a word, phrase, or name where the original expansion has not been rejected by the organization that it refers to and where the abbreviation has not become part of the language."
