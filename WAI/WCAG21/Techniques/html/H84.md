Using a button with a select element to perform an action
=========================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML and XHTML

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 3.2.2: On Input](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/on-input) (Sufficient when used with [G80: Providing a submit button to initiate a change of context](../general/G80)).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to allow the user to control when an action is performed, rather than having the action occur as a side effect of choosing a value for the `select` element. The user may inspect the different values of the `select` element, or may accidentally choose the wrong value, without causing the action to occur. When the user is satisfied with their choice, they select the button to perform the action.

This is particularly important for users who are choosing the value of the `select` element via the keyboard, since navigating through the options of the `select` element changes the value of the control.

Examples
--------

### Example 1: A Calendar

A Web page lets the user choose any month of any year and display the calendar for that month. After the user has set the month and year, he displays the calendar by pressing the "Show" button. This example relies on client-side scripting to implement the action.

    <label for="month">Month:</label>
    <select name="month" id="month">
      <option value="1">January</option>
      <option value="2"> February</option>
      ...
      <option value="12">December</option>
    </select> 
    <label for="year">Year:</label>
    <input type="text" name="year" id="year">
    <input type="button" value="Show" onclick = "...">

### Example 2: Choosing an action

A `select` element contains a list of possible actions. The action is not performed until the user presses the "Do it" button.

    <form action="http://somesite.com/action" method="post">
      <label for="action">Options:</label>
      <select name="action" id="action">
        <option value="help">Help</option>
        <option value="reset">Reset</option>
        <option value="submit">Submit</option>
      </select> 
      <button type="submit" name="submit" value="submit">Do It </button>
    </form>

Tests
-----

### Procedure

For each `select` element/button element combination:

1.  Check that focus (including keyboard focus) on an option in the `select` element does not result in any actions
2.  Check that selecting the button performs the action associated with the current `select` value

### Expected Results

-   All checks are true.
