Supplementing link text with the title attribute
================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML and XHTML

This technique relates to:

-   [Success Criterion 2.4.4: Link Purpose (In Context)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context) (Sufficient when used with an unwritten technique)
-   [Success Criterion 2.4.9: Link Purpose (Link Only)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-link-only) (Advisory)

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to demonstrate how to use a `title` attribute on an anchor element to provide additional text describing a link. The `title` attribute is used to provide additional information to help clarify or further describe the purpose of a link. If the supplementary information provided through the `title` attribute is something the user should know before following the link, such as a warning, then it should be provided in the link text rather than in the `title` attribute.

Because of the extensive user agent limitations in supporting access to the title attribute, authors should use caution in applying this technique. For this reason, it is preferred that the author use technique [C7: Using CSS to hide a portion of the link text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/css/C7) or [H30: Providing link text that describes the purpose of a link for anchor elements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H30).

Examples
--------

### Example 1: Clarifying the purpose of a link

    <a href="http://example.com/WORLD/africa/kenya.elephants.ap/index.html" 
       title="Read more about failed elephant evacuation">
       Evacuation Crumbles Under Jumbo load
    </a>

Tests
-----

### Procedure

Examine the source code for anchor elements.

1.  For each anchor element that has a `title` attribute, check that the `title` attribute together with the link text describes the purpose of the link.

### Expected Results

-   Check \#1 is true.
