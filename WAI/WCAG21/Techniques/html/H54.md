Using the `dfn` element to identify the defining instance of a word
===================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML and XHTML

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 3.1.3: Unusual Words](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/unusual-words) (Sufficient when used with [G112: Using inline definitions](../general/G112)).

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to use the `dfn` to mark the use of a word or phrase where it is defined. The `dfn` element is used to indicate the defining instance of the enclosed term. In other words, it marks the occurrence of the term where the term is defined. Note that it encloses the term, not the definition. This technique would be used in combination with [G112: Using inline definitions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G112) to provide the definition.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

The following code snippet demonstrates the use of the `dfn` element.

    <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines require that non-text content
    has a text alternative. <dfn>Non-text content</dfn> is content that is not a sequence
    of characters that can be programmatically determined or where the sequence is
    not expressing something in human language; this includes ASCII Art (which is a
    pattern of characters), emoticons, leetspeak (which is character substitution), and
    images representing text .</p>

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  Identify all words that are defined inline in the text, that is, where the definition occurs in a sentence near an occurrence of the word.
2.  Check that each word that is defined inline is contained in a `dfn` element.

### Expected Results

-   Check \#2 is true.
