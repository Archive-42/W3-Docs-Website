Using the link element and navigation tools

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

HTML and XHTML

This technique relates to:

-   [Success Criterion 2.4.5: Multiple Ways](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/multiple-ways) (Advisory)
-   [Success Criterion 2.4.8: Location](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/location) (Sufficient when used with [G127: Identifying a Web page's relationship to a larger collection of Web pages](../general/G127))

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to describe how the `link` element can provide metadata about the position of an HTML page within a set of Web pages or can assist in locating content with a set of Web pages. The value of the `rel` attributes indicates what type of relation is being described, and the `href` attribute provides a link to the document having that relation. Multiple `link` elements can provide multiple relationships. Several values of `rel` are useful:

-   Start: Refers to the first document in a collection of documents.
-   Next: Refers to the next document in a linear sequence of documents.
-   Prev: Refers to the previous document in an ordered series of documents.
-   Contents: Refers to a document serving as a table of contents.
-   Index: Refers to a document providing an index for the current document.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

A Web page for Chapter 2 of an on-line book might contain the following links within the `head` section.

    <link rel="Contents" href="Contents.html" title="Table of Contents"  />
    <link rel="Index" href="Index.html" title="Index" />
    <link rel="Prev" href="Chapter01.html" title="01. Why Volunteer?" />
    <link rel="Next" href="Chapter03.html" title="03. Who Volunteers?" />

Tests

### Procedure

For a Web page that is within a sequence or collection of Web pages:

1.  Check that all `link` elements pertaining to navigation occur in the `head` section of the document.
2.  For each `link` element in the `head` section of the document which pertains to navigation, check that it contains at least:

    1.  a `rel` attribute identifying the link type
    2.  a valid `href` attribute to locate the appropriate resource

### Expected Results

-   All of the checks above are true.
