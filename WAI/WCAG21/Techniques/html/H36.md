Using `alt` attributes on images used as submit buttons
=======================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

Applies to content using image-based submit buttons.

This technique relates to [Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content) (Sufficient).

Description
-----------

For input elements of type 'image', the `alt` attribute of the `input` element is used to provide a functional label. This label indicates the button's function, but does not attempt to describe the image. The label is especially important if there are multiple submit buttons on the page that each lead to different results.

The `input` element is used to create many kinds of form controls. Although the HTML and XHTML DTDs permits the `alt` attribute on all of these, it should be used only on image submit buttons. User agent support for this attribute on other types of form controls is not well defined, and other mechanisms are used to label these controls.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

An `input` element with an `alt` attribute

    <form action="http://example.com/prog/text-read" method="post">
      <input type="image" name="submit" src="button.gif" alt="Submit" />
    </form>

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  For all `input` elements that have a type attribute value of "image", check for the presence of an `alt` attribute.
2.  Check that the `alt` attribute indicates the button's function.

### Expected Results

-   \#1 and \#2 are true
