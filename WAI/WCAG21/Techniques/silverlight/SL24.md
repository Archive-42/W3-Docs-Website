Using AutoPlay to Keep Silverlight Media from Playing Automatically
===================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

-   Microsoft Silverlight, versions 3 and greater
-   Silverlight managed programming model and Silverlight XAML

Note

Microsoft has stopped updating and distributing Silverlight, and authors are encouraged to use HTML for accessible web content.

This technique relates to:

-   [Success Criterion 1.4.2: Audio Control](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/audio-control) (Sufficient)
-   [Success Criterion 2.2.2: Pause, Stop, Hide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pause-stop-hide) (Sufficient)

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to use the `AutoPlay` property of `MediaElement` object, which prevents the `MediaElement` from playing its media source automatically.

By default the value of `AutoPlay` is true, which causes any media that is the `Source` of the `MediaElement` to play as soon as either the entire source file is loaded (for nonstreaming media) or an initial buffer is loaded (for streaming media). To prevent the possible accessibility issues, developers can instead specifically set `AutoPlay` to false, so that the user always controls whether the media plays. This technique would thus be used in combination with providing user interface controls that go along with the `MediaElement`, and that enable the user to control the media. In particular, the user interface controls enable the media to play, pause or stop, with event wiring for those controls associated with the Play, Pause or Stop methods of the `MediaElement` object.

Examples
--------

### Example 1: Setting AutoPlay to false, and providing the typical MediaElement controls in the UI

This example has a UI definition in XAML and interaction logic in C\#.

The following is the basic UI in XAML. Note the AutoPlay="false" setting.

    <UserControl x:Class="MediaElementControlsAutoPlay.MainPage"
       xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
       xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
      >
       <Grid x:Name="LayoutRoot">
           <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
               <ColumnDefinition Width="*" />
               <ColumnDefinition Width="*" />
               <ColumnDefinition Width="*"/>
           </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
           <Grid.RowDefinitions>
               <RowDefinition Height="*" />
               <RowDefinition Height="Auto" />
           </Grid.RowDefinitions>
           <MediaElement x:Name="media" Source="/xbox.wmv"
              Width="300" Height="300" 
              Grid.Column="0" Grid.Row="0" Grid.ColumnSpan="3"
              AutoPlay="False"
              AutomationProperties.Name="Video of new Fable game for XBox"           
           />
           <Button Click="StopMedia" 
        Grid.Column="0" Grid.Row="1" Content="Stop" />
           <Button Click="PauseMedia" 
        Grid.Column="1" Grid.Row="1" Content="Pause" />
           <Button Click="PlayMedia" 
        Grid.Column="2" Grid.Row="1" Content="Play" />
       </Grid>
    </UserControl>

The following is the C\# logic.

     private void StopMedia(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
     {
         media.Stop();
     }
     private void PauseMedia(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
     {
         media.Pause();
     }
     private void PlayMedia(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
     {
         media.Play();
     }
     

This example is shown in operation in the [working example of Media Element Controls with AutoPlay False](../../working-examples/silverlight-media-element-controls-auto-play/).

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  Using a browser that supports Silverlight, open an HTML page that references a Silverlight application through an object tag. The application is expected to use a `MediaElement` object to play prerecorded media.
2.  Check that the media does not play automatically as soon as the application loads and displays. Rather, the user is presented with a user interface that can start the media per the user's action.

### Expected Results

\#2 is true.
