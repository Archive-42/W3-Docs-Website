Providing User Instructions With AutomationProperties.HelpText in Silverlight
=============================================================================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

-   Microsoft Silverlight, versions 3 and greater
-   Silverlight managed programming model and Silverlight XAML

Note

Microsoft has stopped updating and distributing Silverlight, and authors are encouraged to use HTML for accessible web content.

This technique relates to:

-   [Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content) (Advisory)
-   [Success Criterion 3.3.2: Labels or Instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/labels-or-instructions) (Advisory)

Description
-----------

The objective of this technique is to provide a long text alternative that serves the same purpose and presents the same information as the original non-text content when a short text alternative is not sufficient, and to show the practice of storing that information in a dedicated property of the Silverlight-supported UI Automation support system. The technique can also be used on text controls (such as `TextBox`), for cases where the control text itself does not provide enough context to suggest an appropriate user action.

The relevant UI Automation property is named `HelpText`, to connote its possible usage to provide imperative instructions for interactive elements. However, the same property can instead be used for long text alternatives for nontext objects. The Silverlight API `AutomationProperties.HelpText` directly sets `HelpText` in the UI Automation tree. The properties in the UI Automation tree are reported to assistive technologies, when the assistive technology implements behavior that acts as a UI Automation client.

`AutomationProperties.HelpText` can be set in code, but is most typically set as an attribute in XAML that defines a Silverlight UI.

The same information as is present in `AutomationProperties.HelpText` could also be useful to sighted users. In this case, the same text could be displayed in a Silverlight [ToolTip](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.tooltip%28VS.95%29.aspx) control. The reason that application authors should use both `AutomationProperties.HelpText` AND `Tooltip` in conjunction is because the `Tooltip` information is not introduced into the runtime accessibility framework information set. This is because a tooltip is transient and not conventionally focusable. In Silverlight programming, a useful technique for sharing the same resource is to combine the Silverlight data binding feature with the .NET Framework embedded resource feature. For more information on combining Silverlight data binding and resources for common string sources, see [How to Make XAML Content Localizable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd882554%28VS.95%29.aspx).

Examples
--------

### Example 1: Applying a long text alternative for an Image with XAML

To introduce the necessary information to Silverlight XAML for an application UI definition, specify the `AutomationProperties.HelpText` attribute on the `Image` element. The value provided for the attribute is a meaningful long text alternative for the image content. The value of `AutomationProperties.HelpText` should augment rather than duplicate `AutomationProperties.Name`, which is also typically specified to provide accessibility support for an image.

     <Image
       Height="400" Width="600"
       Source="/office.png"
       AutomationProperties.Name="Diagram of standard office layout"
       AutomationProperties.HelpText=”The standard office layout
    includes one corner desk unit in the corner farthest from the
    door, and one file cabinet against the same wall as the door.”/>

### Example 2: Using HelpText as form instructions

This example provides instructions for two form fields by using both `Tooltip` and `AutomationProperties.HelpText`. The strings used for these purposes are shared to both methodologies by defining the strings as resources and binding to them. In this example, the form submission does not perform client-side validation (although server-side validation following a data round trip might still exist).

The following is the XAML UI:

    <UserControl xmlns:sdk="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation/sdk" 
       x:Class="HelpTextAndToolTip.MainPage"
       xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
       xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
    >
           <Grid x:Name="LayoutRoot" Background="White" Margin="10">
               <Grid.RowDefinitions>
                   <RowDefinition Height="Auto"/>
                   <RowDefinition Height="Auto"/>
                   <RowDefinition Height="Auto"/>
                   <RowDefinition Height="Auto"/>
                   <RowDefinition Height="Auto"/>
               </Grid.RowDefinitions>
               <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
                   <ColumnDefinition Width="Auto"/>
                   <ColumnDefinition Width="200"/>
                   <ColumnDefinition Width="Auto"/>
               </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
               <TextBlock Text="Form With Tooltips" FontSize="16" FontWeight="Bold"
         Grid.Column="1" HorizontalAlignment="Center" />
               <sdk:Label x:Name="NameLabel" Target="{Binding ElementName=NameTextBox}"
         Grid.Row="2" Margin="3"/>
               <TextBox x:Name="NameTextBox" 
         AutomationProperties.Name="{Binding Content, ElementName=NameLabel}"
         Text="{Binding Name, Mode=TwoWay, UpdateSourceTrigger=Explicit}"
         Grid.Column="1" Grid.Row="2" Margin="3"
         AutomationProperties.HelpText="{Binding
           NameTextBoxToolTipString,Source={StaticResource TooltipStrings}}">
               <ToolTipService.ToolTip>
                   <ToolTip Content="{Binding NameTextBoxToolTipString,Source={StaticResource TooltipStrings}}" />
               </ToolTipService.ToolTip>
               </TextBox>
               <sdk:Label x:Name="AgeLabel" Target="{Binding ElementName=AgeTextBox}"
         Grid.Row="3" Margin="3" HorizontalAlignment="Right"/>
               <TextBox x:Name="AgeTextBox" 
         AutomationProperties.Name="{Binding Content, ElementName=AgeLabel}" 
         Text="{Binding Age, Mode=TwoWay, UpdateSourceTrigger=Explicit}"  
         Grid.Column="1" Grid.Row="3" Margin="3"
        AutomationProperties.HelpText="{Binding AgeTextBoxToolTipString,Source={StaticResource TooltipStrings}}">
               <ToolTipService.ToolTip>
                   <ToolTip Content="{Binding AgeTextBoxToolTipString,Source={StaticResource TooltipStrings}}" />
               </ToolTipService.ToolTip>
           </TextBox>
               <Button x:Name="SubmitButton" Content="Submit" Click="SubmitButton_Click"
                 Grid.Column="1" Grid.Row="4" Width="50" Margin="3" />
           </Grid>
    </UserControl>

The following is the resource definition in app.xaml:

           <ResourceDictionary>
               <resources:Resource1 x:Key="TooltipStrings"/>
           </ResourceDictionary>
           

The generated resource code that defines the "Resource1" class is not shown here because it is mostly infrastructure that is produced by a generation task in Visual Studio. For more information about embedded resources in Silverlight, see [Resources Overview on MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc903945(VS.95).aspx). The resources here contain just two strings, each of which would typically be defined in a Visual Studio .resx file. Resources in a .resx file can be localized or changed separately from code by the appropriate localization toolsets for Microsoft localization/development.

-   NameTextBoxToolTipString: Must be 10 characters or less. Required.
-   AgeTextBoxToolTipString Must be a value between 0 and 120. Required.

These examples are shown in operation in the [working example of Automation Properties Help Text](../../working-examples/silverlight-automation-properties-help-text/) and [working example of HelpText and ToolTip](../../working-examples/silverlight-help-text-and-tool-tip/).

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  Using a browser that supports Silverlight, open an HTML page that references a Silverlight application through an object tag. To see UI Automation, use Microsoft Windows as platform.
2.  Use a verification tool that is capable of showing the full automation tree, and an object’s long text alternative as part of the tree. (For example, use UIAVerify or Silverlight Spy; see Resources links.)
3.  Focus an element that is known to have a long text alternative. Check that the `AutomationProperties.HelpText` as applied to individual UI elements appears as the `HelpText` or `acc_Help` value in the automation tree.

### Expected Results

\#3 is true.
