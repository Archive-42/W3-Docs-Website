Specifying line spacing in CSS
==============================

Important Information about Techniques
--------------------------------------

See [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.1.

Applicability
-------------

All technologies that support CSS

This technique relates to:

-   [Success Criterion 1.4.8: Visual Presentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/visual-presentation) (Sufficient)
-   [Success Criterion 1.4.12: Text Spacing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/text-spacing) (Advisory)

Description
-----------

Many people with cognitive disabilities have trouble tracking lines of text when a block of text is single spaced. Providing spacing between 1.5 to 2 allows them to start a new line more easily once they have finished the previous one.

Examples
--------

### Example 1

Setting the element to 1.5 line height. In the style sheet set the characteristics of the element.

    p { line-height: 150%; }

In the content the element will now be 1.5 line height, throughout the document.

    <p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit …  </p>

### Example 2

Setting a class to 1.5 line height (space-and-a-half line spacing). In the stylesheet, define the class.

    p.tall {line-height:150%}

In the content, call up the class = "left".

    <p class="tall"> Lorem ipsum dolor sit …  </p>

### Example 3

Setting a class to double-spaced line height. In the stylesheet, define the class.

    p.tall {line-height:200%}

In the content, call up the class = "right".

    <p class="tall"> Lorem ipsum dolor sit …  </p>

Tests
-----

### Procedure

1.  Open content in a browser.
2.  Check that the spacing between lines in blocks of text is between 1.5 and 2.

### Expected Results

-   Test Procedure \#2 is true.
