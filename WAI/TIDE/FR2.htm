  Setting the Scene
</H2>
<P>
The World Wide Web has become a vital resource for information and interaction.
Close to 20% of the population experiences some form of disability; many
of these conditions can present barriers to accessing information technology.
It is essential to ensure accessibility of the Web in order to provide access
to educational, employment, commerce and civic participation for individuals
with disabilities.
<P>
The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is hosted by the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C - <A HREF="http://www.w3.org">http:/www.w3.org</A>), an international,
vendor-neutral consortium which develops technologies to promote the
interoperability and evolution of the Web. W3C provides a setting where WAI
can bring together industry, disability organizations, accessibility researchers
and government to explore accessibility requirements and develop consensus-based
accessibility solutions. For the past 18 months, WAI-DE has provided an
opportunity to promote coordination with European organizations focusing
on Web accessibility, and to develop materials and activities to support
outreach to European organizations.
<H2>
  Approach
</H2>
<P>
Accessibility of the Web is an international problem, and any approach to
addressing this problem must coordinate with related international efforts.
To address the issue of Web accessibility within Europe, WAI-DE has worked
in parallel with the international Web Accessibility Initiative hosted by
the World Wide Web Consortium, following W3C process to ensure the broadest
acceptance of its materials. WAI-DE has focused on a number of specific
activities: ensuring European disability community and industry input to
the development of WAI guidelines; developing tools that address interim
accessibility problems before browser developers implement WAI guidelines,
and developing tools that facilitate community review of accessibility of
Web sites; and developing a variety of European-specific education and outreach
materials. WAI-DE has also continued to broaden partnerships with industry,
disability organizations, research centers, and governments in Europe around
issues of Web accessibility, to broaden the basis for consensus on common
approaches for addressing Web accessibility.
<H2>
  Results and Achievements
</H2>
<P class="c2">
This report describes the successful completion of the four work-pages required
under WAI DE 4105: Education, Tools, Standards, and User Forum, as well as
Project Management activities. Under the Education workpackage, WAI DE conducted
25 presentations at European conferences or events, produced leaflets, a
video, resources pages with reference links on policies related to Web
accessibility, a demonstration retrofitting of an inaccessible Web site,
Quick Tips reference cards, and localizations of these cards and several other
materials into European languages. Under the Tools workpackage, WAI DE developed
a table linearizer and a reporting tool for review of Web sites. Under the
Standards activity, WAI DE analyzed relevant standards and guidelines from
national and international standards associations, and recommended activities
to pursue integration of WAI guidelines into the work of these standards
bodies. Under the User Forum, WAI DE maintained a very active e-mail discussion
forum, with hundreds of participants exchanging hundreds of messages per
month. This forum served both for feedback on WAI's work, and as a forum
in which to raise additional issues for WAI to address. The Project Management
workpackage served to provide coordination and oversight among WAI DE
workpackages, and to coordinate between WAI DE, other WAI work, and the project's
host organization, W3C.
<H2>
  Conclusions and Plans for the Future
</H2>
<P class="c2">
Two of the most significant accomplishments of WAI DE have been to develop
strong European involvement in the international Web Accessibility Initiative,
thereby ensuring that the needs of the European community are addressed within
evolving international solutions; and to stimulate additional European-specific
activity in the area of Web accessibility on the part of European organizations
that have participated in and benefited from WAI DE's work. Given the increasing
complexity and pervasiveness of the Web, as well as the advent of multimedia,
distance education, E-Commerce -- there is, however, now more rather than
less work to be done. WAI DE has therefore proposed advanced work in Web
accessibility under the Fifth Framework, IST, to ensure a continuation of
European-specific Web accessibility activities. The proposed activities
would focus on advanced educational work and tools development needed in
Europe.

<H2>
  <A name=setting>1. Setting the Scene</A>
</H2>
<P>
Millions of people use the Web daily for services related to their professional
and personal interests. The Web provides information on every topic; it provides
a vehicle for civic participation, commercial transactions, and education.
It gives people access to world news, employment opportunities, and each
other. Yet for many people with disabilities, it is currently difficult to
access the Web.
<P>
The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) and the WAI DE program are hosted
by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international vendor-neutral
consortium which develops technologies to promote the interoperability and
evolution of the Web. The W3C coordinates the development of core Web protocols
and data formats: HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Synchronized Multimedia
Integration Language (SMIL), Resource Description Framework (RDF), Extensible
Markup Language (XML), and an increasing number of XML-based applications.
W3C provides a setting where WAI can bring together industry, disability
organizations, accessibility researchers and government representatives to
explore accessibility requirements, and develop accessibility solutions.
<P>
The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
focuses on making the Web accessible to existing and potential Web users
who have disabilities. W3C's credibility further assists in ensuring the
successful promotion of WAI guidelines, tools, and educational materials
to a variety of audiences, including browser and authoring tool manufacturers
and site developers.
<P>
For the past 18 months, WAI-DE has provided an opportunity to promote
coordination with European organizations focusing on Web accessibility, and
to develop materials and activities to support outreach to European
organizations.
<P>
As the Web rapidly displaces existing media, there is an increasing social
expectation for its accessibility, and also a growing trend to require
accessibility. This trend, combined with the realization of the benefits
that a Design for All approach can bring to the Web at large (for instance,
to mobile phone users with small display screens), led the W3C to take on
a leadership role and launch the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) in 1997.
<H3>
  Current Situation
</H3>
<P>
Gains in accessibility of the Web are continually threatened by increasing
use of multimedia and advanced Web technologies. At the same time, awareness
of the need for Web accessibility is increasing, but not yet as rapidly as
the spread of the Web itself.
<P>
Web accessibility barriers exist for many kinds of disabilities:
<UL>
  <LI>
    People who are deaf do not have access to multimedia or audio events that
    do not contain captioning.
  <LI>
    People who are blind or who have low vision encounter barriers due to the
    Web's predominantly graphical interface, its graphic-based content, and any
    Web protocol or application that cannot easily be rendered or accessed using
    audio, Braille, large text or synthetic voice.
  <LI>
    People with physical disabilities have difficulty using browsers and authoring
    tools without full keyboard support, and may have difficulty using forms
    or frames that are not marked-up properly.
  <LI>
    People with cognitive or neurological disabilities may have difficulty
    interpreting Web pages that lack a consistent navigation structure or that
    lack visual signposts.
</UL>
<P>
Over the past two years, WAI has developed guidelines and technical reference
documents which have achieved international recognition. Awareness of WAI
guidelines is spreading in both the public and private sectors. Emerging
policy requirements for Web accessibility in various countries, combined
with education and outreach efforts of WAI and WAI DE and collaborating
organizations, should spur this awareness onward.
<P>
In addition to policy requirements for Web accessibility, many organizations
have expressed interest in the carry-over benefits of accessibility for other
users. Even those without disabilities benefit from many changes motivated
by the needs of people with disabilities. When driving a car, for example,
a driver may wish to browse the Web for information using a voice-based interface
similar to that used by someone who is blind. This is sometimes referred
to as "Design for All," or the curb-cut effect, where an accessibility-driven
design such as a mini-ramp in a sidewalk curb allows easier passage for
wheelchair users but is also favored by people pushing baby strollers, riding
bikes, pulling luggage on wheels, etc. In particular, the mobile phone industry
has expressed interest in the contributions of Web accessibility to greater
usability for all.
<P>
WAI's workplan has capitalized on the unique host environment of the W3C
to provide access to the earliest design stages of Web technologies. WAI
has successfully used the formal W3C process for review and approval of
specifications to ensure consensus-based accessibility guidelines; and both
WAI and WAI-DE continue to benefit from the W3C setting in developing
high-quality support and reference materials to assist in promoting these
guidelines.&nbsp;
<P>
  <HR>
<H2>
  <A name=approach>2. Approach</A>
</H2>
<P>
WAI DE's overall approach is to improve accessibility of the Web in Europe
through a variety of activities that are coordinated with and that complement
the work of a broader international initiative.
<P>
W3C has an activity in the area of Web Accessibility, called WAI. We use
"WAI-DE 4105" in this report to indicate the Telematics project. WAI primarily
focuses on technology groups working on the accessibility of the core Web
formats such as HTML, XML, and CSS; and also on a set of guidelines accompanying
the technologies, that address accessibility of Web content, and of browsers
and authoring tools. WAI is organized to pursue accessibility of the Web
through five areas of work:
<OL>
  <LI>
    Technology review and development: centered on protocols and data formats,
    especially HTML, CSS, XML, SMIL, DOM.
  <LI>
    Guidelines for use of the technology: targeted to user agent and authoring
    tool developers, and to Web content developers.
  <LI>
    Education and outreach: raising awareness of the content creation community
    around the concept of Design for All;
  <LI>
    Tools for evaluation and repair of Web pages.
  <LI>
    Coordination with research and advanced development.
</OL>
<P>
From among these work areas, the WAI-DE 4105 project concentrated on education
and outreach in Europe, specification and prototyping of tools, standardisation,
and the hosting of an umbrella User Forum Interest Group.
<P>
Approaches for each of these work-packages are detailed below.
<P>
In order to meet the requirement of internationalization of the approach
for addressing Web accessibility, W3C used its own member funds to complement
those of various industries and governments with funding from the European
Commission. In so doing, it helped ensure participation of W3C staff developing
Web protocols with this European action to ensure that the evolution of the
Web removes, rather than reinforces, barriers to the Web.
<P>
It is important to note that this grant is hosted by the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C), an international non-for-profit, vendor-neutral organization
which fosters the evolution of the major Web protocol and format specifications,
and whose goal is to lead the Web to its full potential (<A href="#w3c">a
long description of W3C</A> is provided in the contact section). Being located
at the heart of Web technology development allows WAI to address accessibility
issues at the beginning of the development cycle, and also to sensitize
technologists world-wide to Design for All principles.
<P>
The WAI-DE 4105 Telematics proposal complements W3C WAI technical work by
addressing content providers -- the people that create and distribute the
information -- and end-users, through its user forum and tool workpackage.
WAI-DE 4105 focuses on the European Web content providers and market. This
approach enables different "stakeholders" in accessibility to work together
at the design table. Over a hundred organizations from around the world
participate in some part of WAI work, including industry, disability
organizations, access research centers, and governments. An increasing number
of these organizations are European, due to WAI-DE 4105's activity.
<P>
As global as the Internet and the Web are, there is still a clear need for
local actions when content providers are the target. A similar fund-raising
activity for education and dissemination is being pursued by W3C for the
Americas and the Pacific rim. We think all these actions are required for
the Web as a whole to become more accessible.
<H3>
  Approach on Management
</H3>
<P>
It is important that the integration between W3C WAI and WAI-DE 4105 has
been tight in order to maximise the leveraging of W3C actions in the DE project.
WAI has therefore extended and improved the overall W3C WAI deliverables
and charters, and cross-linked them with the WAI-DE deliverables.
<P>
W3C has a very formal framework, the W3C Process, for organizing its activities,
under a structure of Working and Interest Groups which must first have defined
charters, that first must define their charters. Most WAI DE work-packages
have been brought under this process.
<P>
To ensure that this integration is well managed, the W3C WAI International
Program Office itself has a Steering Committee, composed of members chosen
by the U.S. National Science Foundation; the European Commission (specified
by the DE Program Director); disability organizations; and industry sponsors
most of which are W3C Members.
<H3>
  Approach on Education &amp; Outreach
</H3>
<P>
In order to improve Web accessibility, it is important to target a variety
of audiences. Content providers are one of WAI's primary targets since they
determine much of the content on Web sites.
<P>
However, content providers are also influenced by other players: authoring
tool vendors, Web site designers, Web-design educators, the press, and the
user base. In order to reach all these communities, WAI must direct its efforts
through a variety of activities -- presentations in major Web industry
conferences; direct contact and awareness action with major European Web
site providers; addition of accessibility "modules" in Web design curricula;
direct contact with major authoring tool providers; submission of articles
to the press, etc.
<P>
Another educational aspect also needs to be explored: the education of the
disability community itself regarding their rights with respect to accessing
information like everyone else. This is particularly timely where some countries
are already subject to existing legislation regarding access (see the US
Americans with Disabilities Act or the UK Disability Discrimination Act).
WAI has compiled a reference list of polices related to Web accessibility,
which has become a key resource for the disability community.
<P>
While education and outreach are crucial aspects of WAI's work overall, these
are not something that has traditionally fallen within W3C's role. Clearly,
part of the raising of awareness should take place as part of the training
that is packaged with any Web authoring tool. But part of this work also
goes beyond individual tools, and is part of the traditional role of government:
helping sensitize key players, including content providers, to the needs
of an important minority population.
<H3>
  Approach on Tools
</H3>
<P>
To complement work on improving Web technologies and producing guidelines,
WAI has been developing tools to evaluate Web Content accessibility and repair
inaccessible pages, and coordinating with organizations that develop such
tools.
<P>
WAI-DE decided to depart from its original tools goal to develop a
&nbsp;Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) accessibility
implementation, and decided to expand the scope of this workpackage beyond
the study and prototyping of <A href="http://www.w3.org/PICS">PICS</A> in
the context of accessibility but to work on the more general problem of
implementing tools that provide evaluation, transformation and repair of
Web sites. One reason was that PICS was becoming a dated technology without
convincing uptake by industry; another was the pressing need for other types
of tools.
<P>
Since many people and organizations are working on such tools within and
outside W3C, and in order to converge on the measurement criteria for Web
accessibility, we first needed to put some effort into coordination in the
area of accessibility validation and tool prototypes. There is also a need
to develop novel tools that end-users have expressed a need for.
<P>
WAI-DE's approach here has been to create and closely integrate with a new
W3C WAI activity focused on tools and supplement it with specific resources
as needed.
<P>
This was organized around a W3C working group called WAI-ER (for Evaluation
and Repair), with a charter to examine:
<OL>
  <LI>
    What features are needed for an <EM>evaluation tool</EM>? &nbsp;This includes
    the question of &nbsp;"rating", e.g. what if any weighting factors should
    be given to problems the evaluation tools detect?
  <LI>
    What features are needed for a <EM>repair tool</EM>?
  <LI>
    What features are needed for "<EM>filtering tools</EM>" used by end users
    to help make sites accessible to them.
  <LI>
    How should features be packaged?
  <LI>
    How should tools be made most usable?
  <LI>
    Once tools are completed (e.g. in beta) what improvement may be made?
</OL>
<P>
We found our early work on PICS Rating System to be usable in this context
(see result section) but we have now allocated more time in the framework
of this ER group on collecting and analyzing input from users who benefit
from these tools, including users with disabilities, Web authors and
administrators, content owners, and tool vendors.
<H3>
  Approach on Standardisation
</H3>
<P>
In order to determine precisely what could be the scope of any future
standardisation activities regarding accessibility of Web-based interactive
applications and services, an investigation was undertaken by our partner
FORTH covering the broad international state of the art.
<P>
This activity aimed at: (a) identifying and assessing the international state
of the art with regards to current, on-going and anticipated future
standardisation activities related to Web accessibility; (b) identifying
the requirements for Web accessibility and developing recommendations for
meeting these requirements; and, (c) disseminating the results to the relevant
national, European and International standardisation bodies. A four-phase
approach has been adopted by the project towards achieving the above objectives,
comprising:
<UL>
  <LI>
    data collection, data analysis, consolidation &amp; recommendations, and
    dissemination phases.
</UL>
<P>
The data collection and data analysis phases provided valuable insight into
what was currently missing from on-going activities related to accessibility
guidelines, recommendations and standardisation work, as well as into existing
and future results that could be propagated towards the relevant communities.
Moreover, the analysis of the collected data enabled the derivation of several
conclusions regarding the present coverage of the work on guidelines and
recommendations, the current standardisation activities in the area of Web
accessibility, and the existing policies and laws at national and European
levels.
<P>
This task also addressed identification of unified interaction requirements
in Web-based applications and services, facilitation of accessible and high
quality interfaces for user with different requirements, and abilities and
preferences, including disabled and elderly, following the concept of design
for all.
<P>
It should be clarified that the standardisation workpackage study is not
at the same level as existing W3C WAI guidelines on Web accessibility. The
latter are of immense practical value, as they offer Web developers immediate
and concrete consensus-based guidance as to how to render the Web content
they produce accessible by people with different types of special requirements.
The work in the standardisation work-package introduces a somewhat different
perspective to the accessibility of Web technologies, with the aim to: (a)
take a further step towards addressing the fullest possible range of user
requirements, across the broad range of existing and forthcoming / future
technologies; and (b) to overcome the difficulty that current accessibility
guidelines and recommendations face in reaching standardisation bodies.
<H3>
  <P class="c7">
  Approach on User Forum
</H3>
<P>
As the internet is the primary discussion forum for development of Web
technologies, it was logical to establish a User Forum using an on-line approach.
This had the additional advantage of facilitating participation across distances
and disabilities, since use of e-mail is generally low-cost and communication
is asynchronous.
<P>
WAI's On-Line User Forum was developed to provide a primary place within
the Web community to discuss issues relating to Web accessibility; to recruit
participants into WAI working groups; to invite feedback on WAI working drafts;
and to exchange strategies on promotion of Web accessibility.
<P>
Occasional face-to-face time was also considered important to enable more
in-depth discussion on specific topics; therefore the User Forum involved
face-to-face meetings several times per year as well.
<P>

  <LI>
    WP03: Tools
  <LI>
    WP04: Standards

Each of these five work-packages comprised several deliverables. Deliverables
were completed as expected, with a few&nbsp;exceptions as noted below where
changes were necessary to better accomplish the objectives of the work-package.

  Original objectives, methodology/approach, and deliverables for WP01, as
  stated in the technical annex:
</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <I>Objectives:</I>
  <P>
  The objective of the management workpackage is to ensure that the workplan,
  targets, milestones and deliverables are met within the agreed time and cost
  schedules.
  <P>
  <I>Work Description (Methodology / Technical Approach):</I>
  <P>
  The co-ordinating partner who will provide the project management will also
  provide the technical management of the project. No distinction is made in
  this package. Consequently, in addition to overall management tools, two
  other issues are addressed: the definition of common methodologies across
  the project, and quality control &amp; assurance. Most of the management
  will be done using day-to-day electronic means between the partners, using
  a mailing list set up by the co-ordinating contractor. In addition, conference
  calls and face-to-face meeting will be scheduled on a regular basis to ensure
  the proper advance of the work.
  <P>
  A Project Steering Committee will be set-up that consists of the two main
  contractor managers, together with one representative of each associated
  contractor and a Quality Panel representative. It is responsible for the
  overall strategy. It also has specific responsibility for ensuring that
  recommendations of the Quality Panel are adhered to by the Workpackage managers
  doing the technical and awareness developments and dissemination.
  <P>
  Meetings will review progress, accept and sign off deliverables, reports
  and demonstrators, and identify and carry out any replanning of the project.
  These meetings will normally be a minimum of one-day duration. At technical
  meetings, each package that is ongoing will present its findings to date
  together with plans for future work. The aim of these technical meetings
  will be to bring the project together at regular intervals to allow partners
  to benefit from the progress being made in different areas of the project.

<B>Satisfaction of Objectives: </B>Project management ensured the successful
completion of overall workplan deliverables, within cost schedules. Several
deliverables ran past their scheduled milestones, but were nevertheless completed
by the end of the project.
<P>
As projected in the original approach/methodology section, a primary means
of coordination was through electronic mail and a&nbsp;mailing-list established
for WAI DE contractors and subcontractors.
<P>
The project manager at INRIA, Daniel Dardailler, as the coordinating partner
for WAI DE, also provided technical management to contractors, through e-mail,
teleconference, and face-to-face. Technical management from the project manager
was supplemented by direct participation of most WAI DE contractors and
subcontractors in the relevant WAI working groups and interest groups; for
example:
<UL>
  <LI>
    WAI Interest Group/ User Forum&nbsp;-- for general discussion of Web
    accessibility needs and feedback on deliverables;
  <LI>
    Education and Outreach Working Group -- for critique of outreach-related
    deliverables such as the Web accessibility film.
  <LI>
    Evaluation and Repair Tools Interest Group -- for feedback on development
    of tools.
</UL>
<P>
Several face-to-face meetings between contractors were held, for in-depth
discussions of project activities. These included a half-day meeting of all
contractors and subcontractors in April 1998, and individual meetings with
subcontractors and the partner contractor in 1998 and 1999. On an as-needed
basis, the project manager arranged additional individual or group telephone
conferences to discuss issues with regard to project coordination or progress
on specific deliverables. These included several teleconferences in the Winter
of 1998 and Spring of 1999. The director of the WAI International Program
Office, Judy Brewer, also met individually and in small groups with all
contractors and subcontractors to help ensure progress and quality of education
and outreach-related deliverables.

  Additional information on WP01, requested by reviewers:
</H4>
<P>
This section provides additional information requested by reviewers on several
questions relating to project management:
<OL>
  <LI>
    Balanced and consistent methods of approach
  <LI>
    Realistic time scales and resource allocations
  <LI>
    Effectiveness of project management techniques
  <LI>
    Strong synergy and integration between different parts of the project
</OL>
<H5>
  1. Balanced and consistent methods of approach:
</H5>
<P>
WAI DE used several management, communication, and quality assurance approaches
consistently across all work-packages. These included:
<UL>
  <LI>
    strong use of electronic communication, including e-mail, mailing lists,
    and a Web site for coordination;
  <LI>
    teleconferences and face-to-face meetings among subcontractors, for in-depth
    discussion of progress on deliverables;
  <LI>
    participation in WAI working groups and activities to broaden feedback on
    subcontractor deliverables;
  <LI>
    strong emphasis on user involvement by all subcontractors.
</UL>
<P>
Given the different types of deliverables under development, there was some
appropriate variation in the methods of approach. For example, a subcontractor
that was developing a short videotape on Web accessibility was asked to
coordinate very closely with WAI's Education and Outreach Working Group [EOWG],
after initial review of the video script showed that more involvement in
message development would be advisable. This coordination include submitting
revised scripts to the EOWG and participating in discussions to review these.
This resulted in a close collaboration between this subcontractor and the
EOWG, and extensive and helpful feedback into the making of the video. In
other cases subcontractors developed their materials in close coordination
with their own user communities. In yet other instances, such as development
of tools to facilitate evaluation of Web site accessibility, these were developed
directly within the Evaluation and Repair Tools Interest Group [ERIG].
<P>
An additional note is that subcontractors were allowed some initial flexibility
in determining the format of outreach-related deliverables. This initial
limited flexibility allowed for the selection of formats in response to needs
in the user community, for instance the RNIB video, which provides a brief
multi-media introduction to concepts of accessibility, and the BrailleNet
leaflet which provides a user-friendly introduction to the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines. It is the project manager's perspective that this
aspect of flexibility allowed the project's approach to remain effective
even within the rapidly changing context of the Web.
<H5>
  2. Realistic time scales and resource allocations:
</H5>
<P>
Resource allocation was adequate in all cases except in the production of
the video, where the contractor, RNIB, had to seek additional resources to
supplement WAI DE funding. Likewise, given the eventual scope of the RNIB
video production, this is the one area of deliverables where the time scales
should also have been longer to allow for the extensive review and feedback
cycles which contributed to the quality of the final product.
<P>
Regarding overall timelines, initial administrative delay in establishing
subcontracts and establishing the Education and Outreach Working Group resulted
in a three-month delay in certain deliverables; this time shift however was
negotiated and approved by the project officer early in the course of the
project. An additional delay at the end of the project resulted from difficulty
collecting the final rounds of paperwork from subcontractors.
<H5>
  3. Effectiveness of project management techniques:
</H5>
<P>
The effectiveness of the project management techniques overall was adequate,
in that quality work was delivered, on budget, and with a few exceptions
within the anticipated timelines.
<P>
However the project manager notes several areas in which management techniques
could be strengthened for future work in this area:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Subcontractors in future work in this area would benefit by more
    initial&nbsp;orientation to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) with which
    WAI and WAI DE are affiliated, so that they more fully understand the industry
    context which this work seeks to impact;
  <LI>
    Subcontractors would benefit by more in-depth orientation to the Web
    Accessibility Initiative itself, which &nbsp;as the project&nbsp;hosted by
    W3C that is addressing accessibility on an international basis, brings together
    industry, research, disability and government representatives, so that they
    understand the diverse requirements which these audiences will bring to any
    critique of deliverables produced through work in this area;
  <LI>
    Project management should convene more frequent teleconferences to monitor
    progress on deliverables , to provide any needed clarifications, and to ensure
    that all deliverables under development are receiving in-depth and timely
    review by the most appropriate groups within WAI.
</UL>
<H5>
  4. Strong synergy and integration between different parts of the project:
</H5>
<P>
Overall there was a high level of synergy between different parts of WAI
DE that contributed to its overall success. This was most evident in the
activities of the INRIA partner and two of the subcontractors, RNIB and
BrailleNet, all of which contributed actively in a variety of ways in the
international WAI project. This integration helped ensure that the work on
any specific work-package was completed with benefit of knowledge of work
underway in other areas, and also served to bring ideas back from those forums
into the organizations of the individual subcontractors. This integration
included participation by representatives of RNIB, BrailleNet, and EBU in
a number of WAI interest groups and working groups, which often resulted
in opportunities for them to interact with each other and with representatives
of other European organizations.
<P>
The part of the project that was least integrated was ICS/FORTH's study on
standardisation, with CNR as a subcontractor. As planned in the original
technical annex, this study&nbsp;was conducted as an independent review of
the standards context and upcoming opportunities to integrate WAI's work
with that of other standards organizations. Any advanced work in this area
would require closer integration with WAI work.

  WP02: Education and outreach
</H3>
<H4>
  Original objectives, methodology/approach, and deliverables for WP02, as
  stated in the technical annex:
</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <I>Objectives:</I>
  <P>
  The goal of this work-package is to promote the realization of accessible
  content throughout the Web.
  <P>
  <I>Work Description (Methodology / Technical Approach):</I>
  <P>
  This needs to be done using education means (teach the content providers
  how to create accessible content), dissemination of information (guidelines
  helping the authoring phases) and awareness (constantly remind new players
  of the issues involved). In order to reach our goal, we need to target different
  audiences.
  <P>
  The content providers are of course our first target, and "in fine" our only
  target, since they will eventually decide what to put on the pages. But for
  doing so, they use, listen, and are influenced by, several other actors:
  authoring tool vendors, web site designers, web-design educators, the press
  and the users base.
  <P>
  In order to reach all these communities, we have to target our effort along
  a series of events: presentations/talks in major Web related conferences,
  organizations of free seminars at these conferences or isolated, direct contact
  and awareness action with major European web site providers, addition of
  accessibility "modules" in the curriculum of the major authoring tools
  educational process, direct contact and lobby with the major authoring tool
  providers, submission of papers in specialized and regular press.
  <P>
  <I>Deliverables:</I>
  <UL>
    <LI>
      D1: Report on presentation/talks/seminar made.
    <LI>
      D2: Accessibility modules for authoring tools.
    <LI>
      D3: Education guideline materials (Markup, Browser).

  Results and achievement for WP02 at project's completion:
</H4>
<P>
<B>Satisfaction of Objectives: </B>This work-package effectively promoted
awareness of Web accessibility throughout the Web in Europe and provided
support for implementation. There was more activity under the Education and
Outreach work-package than originally planned or contracted for. This increased
activity was particularly in the areas of presentations, and development
of educational materials, although it also included more press outreach than
anticipated. The increase was due to a greater perceived need for awareness
and training in the area of Web accessibility than originally anticipated,
a perception which appears accurate as the demand for these materials continues
to increase. Overall, the activity in this area had a substantial impact
on awareness throughout Europe of the need for Web accessibility, and stimulated
the development of several other projects as a result.
<P>
<B>WP02, D1: Report on Presentations Made in European Union Countries under
DE4105:</B>
<P>
WAI staff conducted 25 presentations in European Union Countries during the
project. These presentations served to increase participation in WAI activities,
awareness of WAI resources, implementation of WAI guidelines, and in some
cases to promote the formation of local activities relating to Web accessibility.
A complete list of presentations is available in <B>Appendix 2.1.</B>
<P>
The venues crossed a variety of audiences, including Web industry, accessibility
research, disability community, and government. Topics ranged from a basic
overview of the reasons for addressing Web accessibility, to in-depth technical
presentations to webmasters. The interest level was consistently high across
all audiences, and created an additional demand for presentations which WAI
DE did not have the resources to meet.
<P>
As some of the presentation locations show, WAI-DE has leveraged the new
W3C Office presence (Germany, UK, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, etc) to
do outreach in Europe about Web accessibility. These offices are W3C points
of contact in various countries where the impact of W3C industry outreach
coming from MIT, INRIA or Keio has less impact than does outreach from a
local office.
<P>
Because of the initial ramping-up process to create a formal W3C working
group on Education, this workpackage did not start its activity until the
end of March 1998, so as a result, the beginning and end dates (same duration)
were shifted three months ahead with approval from the Commission office.
<P>
<B>WP02, D2: Accessibility Modules for Authoring Tools -- Demonstration of
Web Site Retrofit for Accessibility</B>
<P>
An inaccessible frame-based Web site was selected from the Web and retrofitted
by correcting five of the most common accessibility errors noted in the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines. The text of the site was first changed
to protect privacy of the original webmasters. This exercise was captured
in an on-line demonstration showing the site before conversion, then introducing
the guidelines and rationales used during conversion, then showing an equally
attractive yet now accessible Web site after conversion. The demonstration
also includes a simulation of browsing using an assistive technology browser
(text-only) such as Lynx, before and after the conversion. This demonstration
has been of great value as a simple tutorial and has generated strong audience
interest. The current version of this demo is online at:
&lt;<A hREF="http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wcagdemo/">http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wcagdemo</A>&gt;
and is also made available on paper (5 copies: <B>Appendix 2.2</B>). The
demonstration will be further developed as a stand-alone tutorial, and offered
for incorporation into tutorial and help files made available by authoring
tool developers.
<P>
A second anticipated deliverable was deferred due to delays in completion
of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-AUTOOLS">Authoring Tool Accessibility
Guidelines</A>, which are guidelines for tool developers that address WYSIWYG
editors, database generation tools, HTML conversion tools, site management
tools, etc. A curriculum module providing in-depth instruction on the Authoring
Tool Accessibility Guidelines has been contracted for and will be developed
with other resources, pending completion of the guidelines on which the
curriculum will be based. In its place, WAI-DE completed several times the
originally planned education guideline materials, described below at WP02,
D3, A-J.
<P>
<B>WP02, D3: Education Guideline Materials</B>:
<P>
A variety of educational materials were developed under WP03 to promote awareness
and implementation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. These materials
are described briefly below, and included in the appendices.
<UL>
  <LI>
    <B>WP02, D3, A: "Web Sites That Work" Video</B>. A 16-minute video
    on how people with disabilities access the Web, and guidelines and
    resources for developing accessible Web sites,&nbsp;was developed
    under subcontract to the Royal National Institute for the
    Blind. Several drafts of the script were reviewed by the Education
    and Outreach Working Group, and received extensive feedback. Five
    copies of the film are made available in the final package, as
    <B>Deliverable 2.3.A. </B> In addition to the film itself, a
    promotional campaign was ran in UK around the "Web Sites That
    Work" Video</B>. The RNIB conducted a major public launch of the
    video at the "Global Cafe" which is an internet cafe in London,
    with approximately 150 people in attendance. The screening was
    directed at Commissioners of Websites (e.g., from banking
    associations). This launch received considerable interest from the
    media and from disability organizations. An awards ceremony was
    conducted at the same time. In addition RNIB is disseminating
    10,000 copies of the video to Web sites developers in the UK.
  <LI>
    <B>WP02, D3, B: Policies Relating to Web Accessibility - European Coverage.</B>
    Through WAI DE4105 activities, reference links to Web accessibility policies
    in Europe were researched and added to an international listing compiled
    through WAI Education and Outreach activities. Initial compilation of European
    policies showed a lag behind Australia, Canada, and the U.S. As a result,
    several European countries initiated policy activities including Portugal,
    Denmark, France, and the UK; and most recently a pan-EU activity has commenced.
    In the case of Portugal, the Portuguese Parliament passed&nbsp;a resolution
    requiring requiring accessibility of the Portuguese Internet, and referenced
    WAI's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines in its report. The policy reference
    page is at
    &lt;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Policy">http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Policy</A>&gt;
    and in <B>Appendix 2.3.B</B>.
  <LI>
    <B>WP02, D3, C: Events calendar - European Coverage</B>: WAI maintains an
    international listing of conferences and related events at which there are
    Web accessibility related presentations or potential opportunities for such
    presentations. Through WAI DE4105 activities, events in Europe were researched
    and added to the calendar. The Events Calendar is available at
    &lt;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Events">http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Events</A>&gt;
    and in <B>Appendix 2.3.C</B>.
  <LI>
    <B>WP02, D3, D: BrailletNet leaflet</B>: The DE4105&nbsp;French subcontractor
    BrailleNet produced a leaflet on Web accessibility, which is intermediate
    between the full Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and the Quick Tips
    in length and complexity. French, English and Spanish versions are available
    on hard copy paper (glossy) for distribution. The launch of this promotional
    material received national press attention in France. Although this first
    version focused on visual impairment, a second version putting the emphasis
    on cross-disability is already under development. This was an important step
    forward for a disability-specific organization such as BrailleNet to address
    not only blindness issues, and this commitment is a direct result of coordination
    with WAI. Samples of the leaflet are available at
    &lt;<A HREF="http://www.braillenet.jussieu.fr/education/livreblanc/english/">http://www.braillenet.jussieu.fr/education/livreblanc/english/</A>&gt;
    and in <B>Appendix 2.3.D.</B>
  <LI>
    <B>WP02, D3, E: Alternative Browsers Reference Links</B>: This is a a
    <A href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Browsing">collection of reference
    links</A> to information, and where possible to demonstration versions of
    alternative browsers, such as text browsers, voice browsers,
    screen-reader/browser combinations, and other assistive technologies such
    as screen magnifiers and speech recognition. This reference page is available
    at

  <LI>
    <B>WP02, D3, F: ERCIM CD -- WAI Section</B>: On the occasion of the 10th
    anniversary of <A href="http://www.ercim.org">ERCIM</A> in 1999 (European
    Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics), the ERCIM asked each
    member organization -- all 14 Computer Science National Labs in Europe --
    to participate in a CD-ROM highlighting two important activities per institute.
    For INRIA, which is the host of W3C in Europe, WAI was chosen and a multimedia
    presentation was designed and incorporated into the anniversary CD. This
    presentation incorporates short clips of the "Web Sites That Work" video
    within a redesigned page layout appropriate to the CD format. Preparation
    of the video required an additional filming session to complete the series
    of clips presenting WAI activities. Five copies of the CD-ROM are part of
    the final package (<B>Deliverable 2.3.F</B>).
  <LI>
    <B>WP02, D3, G: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) -- European
    Localizations</B>: In May 1999, the W3C released
    <A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT">Web Content Accessibility
    Guidelines 1.0</A> (WCAG) which is the foundation document for Web Accessibility.
    The normative document is in English; however several localizations/translations in European
    languages have been coordinated by the WAI-DE project. A mailing list established
    at W3C is used to coordinate this work and arrange reviews of
    translated materials. As of the end of 1999, the following localizations have been completed:
    <A href="http://www.internet.gouv.fr/francais/guide/w3c/w3c.html">French</A>,
    <A href="http://people.frankfurt.netsurf.de/Rene.Hartmann/WAI/webinhalt.html">

  <LI>
    <B>WP02, D3, H: "Quick Tips for Accessible Web Sites" -- European
    Localizations.</B> The Education and Outreach Working Group produced a
    double-sided business card with a concise listing of key concepts from the
    Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. These cards have become very popular,
    with approximately 60,000 distributed to date. Through WAI-DE involvement,
    localization/translation coordination and production in several European languages has
    been arranged. The card in English is available at
    &lt;<A

  Original objectives, methodology/approach, and deliverables for WP03, as
  stated in the technical annex:
</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <I>Objectives:</I>
  <P>
  This work package deals with a novel idea which will use the result of the
  latest development in the area of Web information access: the Platform for
  Internet Content Selection (PICS).
  <P>
  <I>Work Description (Methodology / Technical Approach):</I>
  <P>
  It's about creating a new descriptive rating vocabulary to assess the level
  of accessibility of Web pages and putting it at work with users in a small
  pilot phase involving a community of people with disabilities.
  <P>
  PICS is an infrastructure for associating labels (meta-data) with Internet
  content. It was originally designed to help parents and teachers control
  what children access on the Internet, but it also facilitates other uses
  for labels, including code signing, privacy, or intellectual property rights
  management. We want to create another use for PICS: Level of Accessibility
  of Web Content.
  <P>
  As the PICS syntax and architecture evolves under the auspice of W3C, the
  system developed by this work package will be adapted to meet the new
  requirements.
  <P>
  <I>Deliverables:</I>
  <OL>
    <LI>
      D1: PICS compliant Rating System to assess Accessibility level of Web pages
      (month 6)
    <LI>
      D2: Integration in PC platforms. (month 12)
    <LI>
      D3: Pilot Label database on the Internet (month 12)
    <LI>
      D4: Operational Label Bureau (month 18)

  <P>
  For the last three deliverables, an online demonstration will be available
  to test the system.

<B>Satisfaction of Objectives: </B>As explained in the "Approach to Tools"
section and in interim reports, and with the permission&nbsp;of the Project
Officer, WAI departed from the original plan to develop a PICS rating system

  Original objectives, methodology/approach, and deliverables for WP04, as
  stated in the technical annex:
</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <I>Objectives:</I>
  <P>
  To identify and assess the international state of the art with regards to
  current (on-going) and future standardisation, identify requirements for
  accessibility and develop recommendations, disseminate the results to the
  relevant national, European and International standardisation bodies.
  <P>
  <I>Work Description (Methodology / Technical Approach):</I>
  <P>
  In order to determine precisely what could be the scope of any future
  standardisation activities regarding accessibility of Web-based interactive
  applications and services, a thorough investigation will be undertaken covering
  the broad international state of the art.
  <P>
  This task will also be concerned with the identification of unified interaction
  requirements in Web-based applications and services. Based on such requirements,
  we will then derive recommendations and guidelines towards unified interaction
  in the Web; facilitation of accessible and high quality interfaces for user
  with different requirements, abilities and preferences, including disabled
  and elderly (i.e. following the concept of design for all).
  <P>
  <I>Deliverables:</I>

  Results and achievement for WP04 at project's completion:
</H4>
<P>
<B>Satisfaction of Objectives: </B>As described in the "Approach on
Standardisation" section above, this work-package, completed by FORTH, included
four phases: data collection, analysis, consolidation/recommendations, and
dissemination. All phases were completed according to the original objectives
and work description.
<P>
<B>WP04, D1, Report on data collection methods and data analysis</B>: The
data collection and data analysis phase (presented in
<A href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/DE4105/Report.htm">earlier report</A> provided insight towards gaps in on-going activities
related to accessibility guidelines, recommendations and standardization
work, as well as to how existing and future results might be propagated towards
the relevant communities. Analysis of the collected data enabled conclusions
regarding present coverage of work on guidelines and recommendations, current
standardization activities in the area of Web accessibility, and existing
policies and laws at national and European levels.
<P>
<B>WP04, D2, Draft Report on Standardisation</B>: The draft report, presented
in the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/WAI/DE4105/Report2.htm">Month 12 report</A>,
constituted a preliminary summary of findings and recommendations in the area
of Web accessibility.
<P>
<B>WP04, D3: Final Report on Standardisation</B>: The final deliverable (see
<B>Appendix 4.3</B>) presented a summary account of the activities carried
during the last two phases of the project -- the consolidation/recommendations
and dissemination phases -- and recommended standardisation activities not
addressed by the existing sets of accessibility guidelines and recommendations.
<P>
More specifically, this final deliverable reported on:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Development of process-oriented guidelines and software technology requirements
    aiming to: extend human-centered design practices to better account for
    accessibility; and&nbsp;to guide the evolution of existing or the introduction
    of new Web technologies so that they are inherently accessible by the broadest
    possible range of end-users, under a multitude of usage contexts.
  <LI>
    Dissemination plans for the resulting recommendations in appropriate
    standardisation bodies; alternative target organisations, committees and
    formal standards.
</UL>
<P>
In particular, the development of standardisation recommendations aims to:
(i) provide process-oriented guidance, through guidelines, on accessibility
and universal design in HCI in general, and development of Web-based applications
and services in particular; and, (ii) translate the resulting guidelines
into requirements that need to be met by the interaction platforms and the
development tools, in order for them to provide the required support for
building interactive applications and services accessible by the broadest
possible end-user population, including people with disabilities. The scope
of the process-oriented design guidelines and the corresponding software
technology requirements was deliberately broad in an attempt to provide a
conceptual framework, independent of a particular technology / interaction
platform, whereby universal accessibility is integrated in the development
life-cycle of interactive applications and services. Specifically, the software
technology requirements approached accessibility of the Web as an issue
pertaining to interactive software with particular characteristics (e.g.,
presence of structural and presentational languages), so as to anticipate
future developments and provide generic guidance that would be applicable
beyond the current generation of technologies.
<P>
Following the review of the current situation regarding standardisation work
on Web accessibility and the consolidation of the collected data, alternative
paths were examined and evaluated with the aim to define a specific dissemination
strategy to be followed in the project. Three dissemination channels were
identified as potential candidates for Web accessibility standards, namely:
(a) standards on user-centred design; (b) standards on accessible design;
and, (c) quality standards. The final action plan proposed two alternative
dissemination strategies, taking into account the following criteria:
<UL>
  <LI>
    scope and coverage of particular standard organisations;
  <LI>
    existing committees and current standardisation activities that would be
    willing to accept new items in the specific field;
  <LI>
    processes followed in proposing new standardisation activities and time required
    for development of a standard.
</UL>
<P>
The first of these strategies, which would involve addition of new
recommendations to existing standards, was stated in the report to be difficult
or, in some cases, infeasible. The second, recommended strategy, involved
the introduction of new sections in on-going standardisation activities.
<P>
Future use of the conclusions from this report would require an initial period
of updating, as the contents of various guidelines and the status of relevant
standardisation activities upon which the analysis and recommendations are
based is extremely rapidly-changing, and already outdated in some areas.

  Results and achievement for WP05, at project's completion:
</H4>
<P>
<B>Satisfaction of Objectives: </B>In fulfillment of WP05, WAI established,
and then maintained an <B>On-Line User Forum</B> throughout the duration
of the project. The User Forum's e-mail address is the WAI Interest Group,
at &lt;<A HREF="w3c-wai-ig@w3.org">w3c-wai-ig@w3.org</A>&gt;. Complete archives
of the forum are publicly available on-line at
&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig</A>&gt;.
<P>
Reports on the status of this forum were made to the Commission
following Month 6 and <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/WAI/DE4105/Report2.htm">Month 12</A>,
constituting deliverables D1 and D2 of WP05. A summary report of the
User Forum's activity follows below, constituting deliverable D3 of
WP05. A parallel activity, a <B>User Review Campaign</B>, was
conducted to complement the work of the On-Line User Forum, and
constitutes an additional deliverable, D4, under WP05.
<P>
<B>WPO5, D3, On-Line User Forum</B>: The forum became the leading international
on-line forum for discussing issues of Web accessibility, and developed a
strong European involvement. Participation ranged between 300 and 400
subscribers, with traffic averaging over 500&nbsp;messages per quarter over
the WAI-DE duration of January 1998 to June 1999. Out of a total of 28 countries
represented on the mailing list, European subscription included participants
from 13 European Union countries (all except Austria and Luxemborg):

    inaccessible format for publishing official documents on the Web
  <LI>
    delays in localizations (translations) of screen readers for smaller language
    groups
  <LI>
    policy developments within Europe that will affect requirements for Web
    accessibility
</UL>

<B>WP05, D4: User Review Campaign: </B>An additional deliverable was
conducted under WP05, by the subcontractors of INRIA, with a French
specificity. This section details the method and findings of the
review campaign.
<P>
Between October 1998 and February 1999, BrailleNet users conducted an
experiment with direct reviewing and reporting of Web site
accessibility problems, primarily in France. The study involved
reviews of 111 Web sites, and has been described in a paper presented
at the AAATE Conference in D&uuml;sseldorf, Germany, in November
1999. A summary follows:
<P>
<B>Methodology</B>: Reviewers chose Web sites in several categories, including
on-line newspapers, radio, and television channels; national and international
organizations; public services; culture; education; leisure; and
disability-related Web sites. Accessibility of those 111 Web sites was evaluated
according to W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. An evaluation with
the help of the tool Bobby was not possible because at that time each page
in the sites would have to have been tested separately; moreover some
accessibility problems cannot be evaluated automatically. Two different browsers
were used for the evaluation: Internet Explorer 3, with a Braille display
and a screen reader; and BrailleSurf, a specialized browser developed by
INSERM, with a Braille display and a speech synthesiser.
<P>
<B>Findings:</B> In summary, of the 111 sites, approximately 20% were found
to be completely accessible, 20% rather accessible, 40% not very accessible,
and 20% not accessible at all. The degree of accessibility of the sites was
found to be unrelated to the category in which they belonged, but rather
to the design approaches used by the Web site developer.
<P>
Several points stood out:
<UL>
  <LI>
    The evaluation of these sites shows that on the one hand, many Web site designers
    favour visual design of sites, presumably to attract as many visitors as
    possible.
  <LI>
    On the other hand, other designers favour facilitating access to information
    and site accessibility, for instance most of the sites at international
    organizations.
  <LI>
    Some problems showed gaps in the development of assistive technologies such
    as screen readers, for instance the need for screen readers to become more
    mark-up aware of image maps.
  <LI>
    Other problems showed the need for more awareness of the Web Content
    Accessibility Guidelines on the part of Web designers, to address simple
    technical problems such as adding certain HTML elements or attributes which
    support accessibility, or to ensure accessibility at the early stages of
    site design to avoid the need for later retrofitting.
  <LI>
    Many webmasters appear unaware of how accessibility of their sites may be
    a business advantage.
</UL>
<P>
The analysis of the 111 Web sites showed an on-going need to inform Web site
designers so that the WAI recommendations can be better taken into account.
As a result, letters were sent to Webmasters of selected Web sites, to inform
them about accessibility problems encountered on their sites. The letters
suggested specific design improvements, with pointers to the WAI Web site,
so that they might test accessibility of their sites and find information
on how to improve accessibility of their sites. The letters resulted in dialog
and cooperation from some of the webmasters contacted. The table in <B>Appendix
5.4</B> shows the results of the letter actions and the list of sites reviewed.
<P ALIGN=Left>
This User Review Campaign and follow-up, initially based in France, has provided
the foundation on which WAI is currently developing an international project
which will expand resources for reviewing accessibility of Web sites, and
communication and coordination with a greater number of webmasters.&nbsp;
<P>
  <HR>
<H2>
  <A name=conc>4. Conclusions and Plans for the Future</A>
</H2>
<P class="c2">
As summarized in this report, WAI-DE completed all scheduled deliverables
with the exception of areas where deferrements or exchanges with other
deliverables were discussed with the project officer. In some cases such
as with Education and Outreach, those replacements resulted in completion
of an increased number of deliverables beyond what was originally planned.
The deliverables produced are being used frequently and are generating the
demand for additional materials to supplement these.
<P CLASS=c2>
Given the rate at which new Web technologies are being developed, however,
and the increasing size of the Web community meaning an ever-increasing community
needing education on Web accessibility, there is still more work to be done.
We have therefore proposed to continue the European WAI activities under
the fifth framework (IST), with a focus on advanced education and tools work
needed for Web accessibility in Europe.
<P>
In particular, we believe that a systematic Web site review process needs
to be organized under the auspices of WAI, involving country-specific evaluation
teams with international coordination, together with the creation of a "showcase"
gallery of accessible sites.
<P>
The need for additional work on advanced tools comes from the recognition
that, since&nbsp;some of the Web is &nbsp;today not yet accessible , therefore
we need to develop practical measures to provide access to those Web sites
that cannot or will not improve.
<P>
Finally, we believe that a continuing close collaboration between Web technology
developers, content providers, users, researchers, and government representatives
is beneficial to developing high-quality and consensus-based solutions
for&nbsp;Web accessibility. The World Wide Web Consortium provides an excellent
forum in which to bring these parties together, enabling them to help meet
the needs of people with disabilities in Europe, toward a user-friendly
information society for all.
