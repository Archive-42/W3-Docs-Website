<span id="about">About RDWG</span>
----------------------------------

The mission of the Research and Development Working Group (RDWG) is to increase the incorporation of accessibility considerations into research on web technologies, and to identify projects researching web accessibility and suggest research questions that may contribute to new projects. The desired outcome of more research in web accessibility and awareness of accessibility in mainstream web-related research should decrease the number of potential barriers in future web-related technologies.

RDWG was previously an "Interest Group" and is now a full "Working Group", to allow a more solidly structured core group of participants. See the [current RDWG Charter](charter3), information about [W3C Working Groups, Interest Groups, and Coordination Groups](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/Process-20040205/groups.html), and contact [Shadi Abou-Zahra](http://www.w3.org/People/shadi/) (staff contact) for more information.
