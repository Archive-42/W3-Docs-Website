Digital Accessibility Foundations Free Online Course
====================================================

> Accessibility skills are increasingly in demand. With this course, you can build your accessibility skills and immediately apply what you learn in practice.
>
> Ms. Natalia Amelina, [UNESCO Institute for Information Technologies in Education (IITE)](https://iite.unesco.org/about-unesco-iite/)

Motivations
-----------

The “**[Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.edx.org/course/web-accessibility-introduction)**” online course provides **the foundation you need to make your digital technology accessible**, so that it:

-   works well for people with disabilities
-   meets international standards
-   enhances the user experience for everyone
-   achieves goals

Accessibility is essential to create high-quality apps, websites, and other digital content — and to not exclude people from using your products and services.

What you get from the course
----------------------------

The course is structured so that you can focus on the topics that you are most interested in. Optional activities and additional materials provide more learning on specific topics.

For example, you can choose to focus on:

-   **Coding** web applications to meet international W3C standards.
-   **Designing** interfaces to meet the needs of people with disabilities, including older users.
-   **Writing** a business case to present to management.
-   **Advocating** for accessibility by understanding real-life experiences of how accessibility is essential for some, and useful for all.
-   **Managing** accessibility in projects and in organizations.
-   **Checking** web pages for basic accessibility issues and improving accessibility.

We encourage you to go through the whole course, even if you focus more on some topics.

### Course content (syllabus)

<img src="/WAI/content-images/wai-fundamentals-overview/wcag2.1AAA-blue-v.svg" alt="W3C WAI-AAA WCAG 2.1 logo" class="small right" />

The course covers principles from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative’s (WAI) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), and much more:

-   What is Web Accessibility (2 sections) — challenges the way you may approach accessibility.
-   **People and Digital Technology** (5 sections) — gives you the “why” behind the what you need to do for accessibility.
-   Business Case and Benefits (2 sections) — explains how accessibility can expand market reach, demonstrate social responsibility, drive innovation, and minimize legal risk.
-   **Principles, Standards, and Checks** (5 sections) — guides you through understanding accessibility requirements and checking for accessibility barriers (also called evaluating or testing for errors or bugs) — with non-technical and technical guidance; provides optional material for learning more about coding accessibly.
-   Getting Started with Accessibility (2 sections) — explains approaches for integrating accessibility into your design and development processes; provides tips for getting started with accessibility right away.

*More “What you’ll learn” and syllabus is in the [edX course page](https://www.edx.org/course/web-accessibility-introduction).*

Duration
--------

> It’s easy to follow and complete. You can do it over several sessions at your own pace.

> [Laiya Lee <span lang="zh">李荔雅</span>  
> The nerdy gurl next door](https://twitter.com/YULaiLai/status/1331577142640058368)

The course is designed to take about **16-20 hours to complete** for most people. It is listed as 4 weeks of 4-5 hours effort per week.

It is **self-paced** so you can complete it in a shorter or longer time frame.

This course will be available on the edX platform through at least the end of 2021. We expect an updated version of this course to be available long term.

Cost: Free, optional certificate
--------------------------------

**The course is free.** The audit option gives you access to all of the content.

<img src="/WAI/content-images/wai-fundamentals-overview/certificate.png" class="normal right" />

Optionally, you can choose to get a **Verified Certificate** for $99 USD to demonstrate successful course completion.

The Certificate can be printed, listed in resumes, and linked to from online profiles.

You can start auditing the course now, and later choose to get a Verified Certificate.

**Transcript:**

Shadi: I’m Shadi Abou-Zahra, Accessibility Strategy and Technology Specialist at W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium.

Natalia: I’m Natalia Amelina, Senior National Project Officer in Education at the UNESCO Institute for Information Technologies in Education.

Shadi: Join us in this course to learn the fundamental skills and key resources that are becoming increasingly important across digital professions.

Natalia: In according with statistics, people with disabilities can make up around 15% of the population – and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognizes access to information as a human right. And you may know that this Convention was ratified by 180 countries all over the world, very likely including your country too.

Shadi: In this course you will learn how people with disabilities use the web including different types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies.

Natalia: You will also learn how web accessibility improves user experience of older people, people using mobile devices, and essentially for everyone.

Shadi: And, of course, you’ll also learn all about the international standards from W3C – and training materials and learn first steps in creating accessible web content.

Natalia: This course was designed for technical and non-technical people. If you work with digital technologies this course is ideal for you to get started.
