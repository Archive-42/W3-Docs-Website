    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft propose the addition of support for a
      standard color space, sRGB, within the Microsoft operating systems, HP
      products, the Internet, and all other interested vendors. The aim of this
      color space is to complement the current color management strategies by
      enabling a third method of handling color in the operating systems, device
      drivers and the Internet that utilizes a simple and robust device
      independent color definition. This will provide good quality and backward
      compatibility with minimum transmission and system overhead. Based on a
      calibrated colorimetric RGB color space well suited to Cathode Ray Tube
      (CRT) monitors, television, scanners, digital cameras, and printing
      systems, such a space can be supported with minimum cost to software and
      hardware vendors. Our intent here is to promote its adoption by showing
      the benefits of supporting a standard color space, and the suitability of
      the standard color space, sRGB, we are proposing. We will describe some of
      the system issues and propose a methodology for to implement support for
      sRGB and color management on the World Wide Web.
    </p>

    <h1 class="partHeading">
      Part 1 : History and Background of sRGB color space
    </h1>

    <h2>A Perceived Need</h2>
    <p>
      Recently the
      <a href="http://www.color.org">International Color Consortium</a> has
      proposed breakthrough solutions to problems in communicating color in open
      systems. Yet the
      <a href="ftp://sgigate.sgi.com/pub/icc/ICC32.pdf">ICC profile</a> format
      does not provide a complete solution for all situations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, the ICC has one means of tracking and ensuring that a color is
      correctly mapped from the input to the output color space. This is done by
      attaching a profile for the input color space to the image in question.
      This is appropriate for high end users. However, there are a broad range
      of users that do not require this level of flexibility and control.
      Additionally, most existing file formats do not, and may never support
      color profile embedding, and finally, there are a broad range of uses
      actually discourage people from appending any extra data to their files. A
      common standard RGB color space addresses these issues and is useful and
      necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      We expect application developers and users that do not want the overhead
      of embedding profiles with documents or images to convert them to a common
      color space and store them in that format. Currently there is a plethora
      of RGB monitor color spaces attempting to fill this void with little
      guidance or attempts at standards. There is a need to merge the many
      standard and non-standard RGB monitor spaces into a single standard RGB
      color space. Such a standard could dramatically improve the color fidelity
      in the desktop environment. For example, if operating system vendors
      provide support for a standard RGB color space, the input and output
      device vendors that support this standard color space could easily and
      confidently communicate color without further color management overhead in
      the most common situations. The three major factors of this RGB space are
      the colorimetric RGB definition, the equivalent gamma value of 2.2 and the
      well-defined viewing conditions, along with a number of secondary details
      necessary to enable the clear and unambiguous communication of color.
    </p>

    <h2>Colorimetric RGB</h2>
    <p>
      The dichotomy between the device dependent (e.g. amounts of ink expressed
      in CMYK or digitized video voltages expressed in RGB) and device
      independent color spaces (such as CIELAB or CIEXYZ) has created a
      performance burden on applications that have attempted to avoid device
      color spaces. This is primarily due to the complexity of the color
      transforms they need to perform to return the colors to device dependent
      color spaces. This situation is worsened by a reliability gap between the
      complexity and variety of the transforms, making it hard to ensure that
      the system is properly configured.
    </p>

    <p>
      To address these concerns and serve the needs of PC and Web based color
      imaging systems, we propose a colorimetric RGB specification that is based
      on the average performance of personal computer displays. This solution is
      supported by the following observations:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Most computer monitors are similar in their key color characteristics -
        the phosphor chromaticities (primaries) and transfer function
      </li>

      <li>
        RGB spaces are native to displays, scanners and digital cameras, which
        are the devices with the highest performance constraints
      </li>

      <li>
        RGB spaces can be made device independent in a straightforward way. They
        can also describe color gamuts that are large enough for all but a small
        number of applications.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This combination of factors makes a colorimetric RGB space well suited for
      wide adoption since it can both describe the colors in an unambiguous way
      and be the native space for actual hardware devices. This, many readers
      will recognize, describes in a roundabout way what has been the practice
      in color television for some 45 years. This proven methodology provides
      excellent performance where it is needed the most, the fast display of
      images in CRT monitors.
    </p>

    <h2>Gamma and the desired CRT gamma of 2.2</h2>
    <p>
      For computer software and hardware designers the most significant aspect
      of the proposed space is the 2.2 CRT gamma. Because gamma correction tends
      to be a topic surrounded by confusion, it is worthwhile spending a few
      paragraphs discussing it.
    </p>

    <h3>Definitions of gamma</h3>
    <p>We start this discussion by defining four separate aspects of gamma.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <i>viewing gamma</i> - the overall system gamma that we want to obtain
        and is typically computed by multiplying the camera gamma by the display
        gamma as shown below.

        <p class="eqn" align="right">
          <img
            src="srgb02"
            alt="viewing gamma = camera gamma &#215; display gamma"
            align="left"
          />
          (0.1)
        </p>
        <br clear="all" />
      </li>

      <li>
        <i>camera gamma</i> - the characteristic of the image sensor or video
        camera standard transfer function
      </li>

      <li><i>CRT gamma</i> - the gamma of the physical CRT.</li>

      <li><i>LUT gamma</i> - the gamma of the frame buffer lookup table</li>

      <li>
        <i>display gamma</i> - the &quot;display system&quot; gamma downstream
        of the frame buffer which is typically computed by multiplying the CRT
        gamma by the LUT gamma as shown below.

        <p class="eqn" align="right">
          <img
            src="srgb01"
            alt="display gamma = CRT gamma 
&#215; LUT gamma"
            align="left"
          />(0.2)
        </p>
        <br clear="all" />
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      These definitions have been kindly provided by the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> and are
      included in the PNG file format specification available at
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR/REC-png-multi.html"
        >http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR/REC-png-multi.html</a
      >. These definitions do <i>not</i> describe the individual gamma parameter
      in equation 0.4 below. Instead, they describe the resulting power
      parameter of the appropriate transfer function when fit by a power
      function. It is extremely important to keep this distinction clear or else
      one implicitly assumes equations 0.4 and 0.5 are equivalent and the system
      black level is truly 0.0 and the system gain is 1.0.
    </p>

    <h3>Viewing Gamma</h3>
    <p>
      The reason that a viewing gamma of 1.125 is used instead of 1.0 is to
      compensate for the viewing environment conditions, including ambient
      illumination and flare. Historically, viewing gammas of 1.5 have been used
      for viewing projected slides in a dark room and viewing gammas of 1.25
      have been used for viewing monitors in a very dim room. This very dim room
      value of 1.25 has been used extensively in television systems and assumes
      a ambient luminance level of approximately 15 lux. The current proposal
      assumes an encoding ambient luminance level of 64 lux which is more
      representative of a dim room in viewing computer generated imagery. Such a
      system assumes a viewing gamma of 1.125 and is thus consistent with the
      709 standard described below. While we believe that the typical office or
      home viewing environment actually has an ambient luminance level around
      200 lux, we found it impractical to attempt to account for the resulting
      large levels of flare that resulted. In addition, recent work by the ISO
      JTAG2 standards committee supports the ambient luminance level of 64 lux.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the viewing condition is different from the standard, then the decoding
      process must compensate. This can be done by modifying the gamma values in
      equation 1.2 below by the appropriate factor. If one does modify the gamma
      values in equation 1.2 below, extreme care must be taken to avoid
      quantization errors when working with 24 bit images and high viewing flare
      levels.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ITU-R BT.709 transfer function in combination with its target monitor
      is attempting to achieve a viewing gamma of 1.125 by incorrectly assuming
      a CRT gamma of 2.5 and an LUT gamma of 1.0/2.222 as shown in the equation
      below. The justification of a viewing gamma value of 1.125 is described
      below in the section on viewing environment compensation.
    </p>

    <p class="eqn" align="right">
      <img alt="illustration" src="srgb03" align="left" /> (0.3)
      <br clear="all" />
    </p>

    <p>
      Using the actual power function fit value for the 709 transfer function of
      1.0/1.956 and maintaining the display gamma of 1.125, we can solve for the
      ideal target monitor gamma of 2.2. This is consistent with the CRT gamma
      value proposed in this paper.
    </p>

    <h3>Camera Gamma</h3>
    <p>
      The camera gamma 1.0/2.2 was the standard for television camera encoding
      before the advent of color TVs and was formalized in 1953 with the NTSC
      broadcast television standards. More recently ITU-R BT.709 has been
      adopted internationally and contains camera gamma of 1.0/1.956. The actual
      exponent factor in the 709 transfer function is 1.0/2.222. Despite the
      fact that the exponent of the 709 function is 1.0/2.222, the actual 709
      encoding transfer function is closer to a CRT gamma of 1.0/1.956 than
      1.0/2.222. This is due to the large offset of 0.099 in the transfer
      function equation. This is well matched to the eye's own non-linearity and
      it helps minimize transmission noise in the dark areas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Broadcast television camera gamma standards and the ITU-R BT.709 standard
      in particular defines the transformation of real world CIEXYZ tristimulus
      values into a target RGB monitor space. This is essentially a composite of
      two transformations; one from real world CIEXYZ tristimulus values into
      standard monitor CIEXYZ tristimulus values and one from these standard
      monitor CIEXYZ tristimulus values into standard monitor rgb values. The
      resulting image is not an exact appearance match of the original scene,
      but instead is a preferred reproduction of the original scene that is
      consistent with the limitations of a monitor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because all television sets have to display content generated with this
      encoding, it was very important for all CRT gamma designs to conform to
      it. Only recently has the computer monitor market become as large as the
      TV market. As a result, most computer monitors still perform optimally
      with imagery using with a camera gamma value of approximately 1.0/1.956
    </p>

    <h3>CRT Gamma</h3>

    <p>
      The non-linearity of the electro-optical radiation transfer function of
      CRTs is often expressed by a mathematical power function exponent
      parameter called gamma. This transfer function describes how much visible
      radiant energy (cd/m<sup>2</sup>) results from voltages applied to the CRT
      electron-gun. Because most of the other characteristics of CRT based
      computer monitors are linear (including DACs and video amplifiers) the
      resulting transfer function has the same gamma value determining its
      non-linearity.
    </p>

    <p class="eqn" align="right">
      <img alt="illustration" src="srgb04" align="left" /> (0.4)
      <br clear="all" />
    </p>

    <p>
      Where k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>2</sub> are the system gain and offset, D is
      the normalized pixel value, A is the maximum luminance of the CRT and I is
      the resulting luminance. This equation and a thorough analysis of the CRT
      characteristics and history are well described in &quot;An Analytical
      Model for the Colorimetric Characterization of Color CRTs&quot; by Ricardo
      Motta, Rochester Institute of Technology, 1991.
    </p>

    <p>
      The key point that we wish to convey here is that gamma component of the
      CRT gamma is dependent only on the electron gun design, and the vast
      majority of monitors and TV sets in use today are based on designs that
      result, on average, in the value 2.2 for gamma component of the CRT gamma
      and a 2.2 overall CRT gamma value when typical system gain and offsets are
      optimally set. Most of the variation between computer monitors and between
      TV sets are due to the differences in system gain and offsets (k<sub
        >1</sub
      >
      and k<sub>2</sub>), which are partially under control of the user in the
      form of contrast and brightness knobs. Unfortunately, the actual set-up is
      often not known, but the best CRT performance happens when the system
      offset puts the dark parts of the images at the CRT cut-off, i.e. the
      black (pixel value 0) parts of the CRT image are just about to emit light.
      Under these conditions equation 0.4 above becomes
    </p>

    <p class="eqn" align="right">
      <img alt="illustration" src="srgb05" align="left" /> >(0.5)<br
        clear="all"
      />
    </p>

    <p>
      and the monitor has the widest-dynamic range. Unfortunately, this is not
      the common condition. Unfortunately the simplified form in equation 0.5 is
      what is usually found in the computer literature.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are significant variations, with widest variations being in the
      set-up and screen reflectivity (older and less expensive display can
      reflect up to 20% of the ambient light). These factors typically can not
      be characterized a priori since they might change in the course of the day
      (ambient light) and at the whim of the user (by modifying contrast and
      brightness). Yet, in practice, the process tends to be self-regulatory,
      with users looking for darker places to set their monitors and modifying
      the controls to re-establish the expected display appearance. Exhaustive
      testing carried on at Hewlett-Packard on VGA computer monitors from many
      brands has shown the average CRT gamma to be indeed 2.2, with a standard
      deviation of about 0.2.
    </p>

    <h3>LUT gamma</h3>
    <p>
      Two special circumstances will lead computer systems to systematically
      deviate from the 2.2 CRT gamma and the 1.0 LUT gamma that we propose -
      color dithering for 16 color systems and system imposed gamma correction
      via look-up-tables (LUT).
    </p>

    <p>
      The first of course was very common until a few years ago. Until about
      1993 most Windows PCs were well described by a display gamma of 1.8
      because despite having 2.2 CRT gamma systems, the colors were dithered
      into the 4 bit frame buffers, resulting in a flattening of the system
      transfer function. This happens because screen dithering mixes colors
      linearly in the eye, making it less dependent on the CRT non-linearity.
      Since currently most Windows PC support 16 or 24 bit color modes, 2.2 CRT
      gamma is now the average.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second systematic deviation happens when the graphics system in the
      computer hardware or software imposes its own gamma correction. This is
      done for a variety of reasons, but is usually an attempt to compromise
      between image display and graphics/image processing performance (most
      computer graphic rendering assumes linear radiation space, e.g.
      transparency operations, and so does image processing, e.g. scaling and
      filtering). The gamma correcting of image data can be described by
      applying an exponent to the image data. For the Macintosh the display
      gamma is around 1.571 using a LUT gamma of 1.4 (2.2/1.4 = 1.571) and for
      SGI workstations the display gamma is around 1.294 using a LUT gamma of
      1.7 (2.2/1.7 = 1.294).
    </p>

    <p>
      There has been significant confusion derived from assuming the CRT gamma
      value is identical to the exponent in equation 0.4. This has led to many
      claims of CRT gamma values of 2.5 for video, 1.8 for the Apple Macintosh
      and 1.4 for SGI monitors. Unfortunately, it has been our experience that
      this misconception is not well founded in the actual physics of the
      displays and solid measurements.
    </p>

    <h2>sRGB and ITU-R BT.709 Compatibility</h2>
    <p>
      There has been some confusion in previous versions of this proposal with
      respect to compatibility with the ITU-R BT.709 standard. Many readers have
      also expressed concern for compatibility with the 709 recommendation in
      general. After review, the authors have confirmed the compatibility
      between this proposal and the 709 recommendation. Unfortunately, the ITU-R
      BT.709 standard can be somewhat confusing for many readers. Below is an
      attempt to clarify and reduce this confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a single color space to achieve acceptance, it must be objective, that
      is, have a tightly-defined relationship with the CIE standards. We are
      fortunate to have obtained in April 1990 unanimous worldwide agreement on
      a calibrated nonlinear RGB space for HDTV production and program exchange:
      Rec. ITU-R BT.709. This recommendation specifies the encoding of real
      world scene tristimulus values into a standard monitor RGB color space
      assuming a dark viewing condition. HP and Microsoft suggest using these
      parameters as the basis for the sRGB color space but with a dim viewing
      condition which is closer to most typical viewing environments for
      computer displayed imagery. Unfortunately the ITU specification is rather
      vague on defining the target monitor. This paper attempts to provide a
      clear and well defined target monitor for the Rec. ITU-R BT.709 camera
      encoding standard for a dim viewing environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ITU-R BT.709 standard specifically describes the encoding transfer
      function for a video camera that when viewed on a &quot;standard&quot;
      monitor will produce excellent image quality. The implicit target of this
      encoding is a standard video monitor whose transfer function or CRT gamma
      is <i>not</i> explicitly delineated. Instead a typical monitor setup is
      assumed. This paper attempts to explicitly describe a standard monitor
      setup that is compatible with the 709-encoding standard.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is illustrated in Figures 1-3 below. Figure one is directly derived
      from the ITU-R BT.709 standard. This standard provides mathematical
      methods to transform from tristimulus values of the scene using a video
      camera into a reference monitor device space.

      Figure two expands the implicit step of these methods and shows the
      transformation between the original scene tristimulus values into the
      target monitor tristimulus values. Since these two viewing conditions are
      different, an implicit compensation is made to account for these
      differences (i.e. flare and ambient luminance). In order to provide an
      independent monitor reference color space, the monitor compensation
      methods must be extracted from this confounded compensation. This is
      precisely the goal of the sRGB color space.

      Figure three illustrates both the sRGB color space and the extraction of
      the monitor only specifications implicit within the ITU-R BT.709 standard.
      By producing such a monitor space, one can then transfer the ITU-R BT.709
      encoded signals to other devices. By building on this system, the sRGB
      color space provides a monitor definition that can be used independently
      from the ITU-R BT.709 standard while maintain compatibility. This allows
      for the well-defined transfer of color information across the World Wide
      Web as described in the other section of this paper.

      This sRGB recommendation essentially defines the second part of this
      transformation between the target RGB monitor space and the monitor CIEXYZ
      tristimulus values in a dim viewing environment. This is required to
      maintain a consistent monitor centric color reproduction process that is
      typical of the web and is consistent with recommendations of the
      International Color Consortium. This is also consistent with maintaining
      the preferred reproduction encoding of the ITU standard.

      In summary, there has been some concern with the choice of a 2.2 CRT gamma
      with a 1.0 LUT gamma as opposed to a 1.571 (2.2/1.4) or a 1.294 (2.2/1.7)
      display gamma. We feel that there are many reasons to support a 2.2 CRT,
      including;
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>compatibility with a large legacy of images</li>
      <li>Photo CD,</li>
      <li>many Unix workstations,</li>
      <li>PC's with 256+ colors and their desktop color schemes and icons,</li>

      <li>several ultra-large image collections,</li>
      <li>analog television,</li>
      <li>Apple Macintosh video imagery,</li>
      <li>CCIR 601 images,</li>
      <li>a better fit with Weber's fraction,</li>
      <li>compatibility with numerous standards,</li>
      <li>TIFF/EP,</li>
      <li>EXIF,</li>
      <li>digital TV,</li>
      <li>HDTV,</li>
      <li>analog video,</li>
      <li>PhotoCD,</li>
      <li>it is closer to native CRTs gamma,</li>
      <li>and consistency with a larger market of displays.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Alpha Channel Masking and Computer Graphics Compatibility</h2>
    <p>
      Another concern that has been expressed about encoding using a gamma of
      2.2 is the use of alpha masking. Typically computer graphics effects,
      including alpha masking, operate in an optical intensity environment as
      opposed to a visually uniform one. This mandates using a linear gamma of
      1.0 in most computer graphic operations which is obviously incompatible
      with the visually uniform encoding using a gamma of 2.2. In a 24 bit
      encoding scheme, encoding a mid-level gray using a gamma of 1.0 would
      result in a digital count of 46. Such an encoding scheme would create
      visually objectionable artifacts such as contours. Therefore we recommend
      that effects such as alpha masking be performed either prior to encoding
      or by decoding to a color resolution greater than 24 bits and then
      converting into linear intensity space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Again, it is fundamental to realize that there are two common operational
      spaces discussed here; 1) the linear intensity space in which most optical
      and synthetic visualization operations work within and 2) a nearly
      visually perceptibly uniform space in which visual based operations,
      compression and many devices work within. This difference is vitally
      important to remember since both types of operations are required and thus
      interaction between these two types of spaces occur frequently.
    </p>

    <h1 class="partHeading">Part 2: Definition of the sRGB Color Space</h1>

    <h2>A Single RGB Standard Color Space</h2>
    <p>
      There are two parts to the proposed standard described in this paper; the
      viewing environment parameters with its dependencies on the human visual
      system and the standard device space colorimetric definitions and
      transformations. The viewing environment descriptions contain all the
      necessary information, when combined with most color appearance models, to
      provide conversions between the standard and target viewing environments.
      The colorimetric definitions provide the transforms necessary to convert
      between the sRGB color space and the CIEXYZ two degree observer color
      space.

      The sRGB reference viewing environment corresponds to conditions typical
      of monitor display viewing conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <i>luminance level</i> is representative of typical CRT display
      levels.
    </p>

    <p>
      The chromaticities of the <i>illuminant white</i> are those of CIE
      D<sub>65</sub>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <i>image surround</i> is defined as &quot;20%&quot; of the maximum
      white luminance. This is close to a CIELAB L* value of 50, while
      maintaining computational simplicity. The areas surrounding the image
      being viewed are similar in luminance and chrominance to the image itself.
      This surround condition would correspond, for example, to a reflection
      print displayed on a spectrally non-selective gray background of about
      twenty percent reflectance, where the print and the background are
      uniformly illuminated by the same light source.
    </p>

    <p>
      This specification defines the concepts of an encoding viewing environment
      and a typical viewing environment. The encoding viewing environment is
      consistent with recent discussions within the ISO JTAG2 committee for
      graphic arts and photographic viewing conditions for photographic images
      on monitors. If possible to achieve, this is the recommended viewing
      environment for viewing photographic images on monitors. The typical
      viewing environment is representative of a typical office or home office
      viewing environment for personal computers.
    </p>

    <p>
      For optimal results, we recommend using the encoding viewing environment
      when viewing sRGB encoded images. We also recognize that this is quite
      different from typical viewing environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      While one would theoretically use the viewing conditions which represent
      the actual or typical viewing environment, if this is done with 24 bit
      images a significant loss in the quality of shadow detail results. This is
      due to encoding the typical viewing flare of approximately 5.0 percent
      into a 24 bit image as opposed to the encoding viewing flare of 1 percent.
      Therefore we recommend using the encoding viewing environment for most
      situations including when one's viewing environment is consistent with the
      typical viewing environment and not the encoding viewing environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <i>encoding ambient illuminance level</i> is intended to be
      representative of a dim viewing environment. Note that the illuminance is
      at least an order of magnitude lower than average outdoor levels and
      approximately one-third of the typical ambient illuminance level.
    </p>

    <p>
      The chromaticities of the <i>encoding ambient white</i> are those of CIE
      D<sub>50</sub>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Encoding viewing flare</i> is specified to be 1.0% of the maximum
      white-luminance level.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <i>typical ambient illuminance level</i> is intended to be
      representative of a typical office viewing environment. Note that the
      illuminance is at least an order of magnitude lower than average outdoor
      levels.
    </p>

    <p>
      The chromaticities of the <i>typical ambient white</i> are those of CIE
      D<sub>50</sub>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Typical Viewing flare</i> is specified to be 5.0% of the maximum
      white-luminance level.
    </p>

    <h2>Colorimetric definitions and digital encodings</h2>
    <p>
      sRGB in combination with the reference viewing environments can be defined
      from standard CIE colorimetric values through simple mathematical
      transformations.
    </p>

    <p>
      CIE colorimetry provides the basis for sRGB encoding of the color. For the
      calculation of CIE colorimetric values, it is necessary to specify a
      viewing environment and a set of spectral sensitivities for a specific
      capture device. The definitions for RGB given in equations 1.1 to 1.3 are
      based on the colorspace's respective viewing environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The CIE chromaticities for the red, green, and blueITU-R BT.709 reference
      primaries, and for CIE Standard Illuminant D<sub>65</sub>, are given in

      sRGB tristimulus values for the illuminated objects of the scene are
      simply linear combinations of the 1931 CIE XYZ values and these
      <i>RGB</i> tristimulus values can be computed using the following derived
      relationship:
    </p>

    <p align="right" class="eqn">
      <img alt="illustration" src="srgb09" align="left" /> (1.1)<br
        clear="all"
      />
    </p>

    <p>
      In the RGB encoding process, negative sRGB<sub> </sub>tristimulus values,
      and sRGB tristimulus values greater than 1.00 are not typically retained.
      When encoding software cannot support this extended range, the luminance
      dynamic range and color gamut of RGB is limited to the tristimulus values
      between 0.0 and 1.0 by simple clipping. This gamut, however, is large
      enough to encompass most colors that can be displayed on CRT monitors<sub
        >.</sub
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      The sRGB tristimulus values are next transformed to nonlinear sR'G'B'
      values as follows:
    </p>

    <p>If <img alt="illustration" src="srgb10" /></p>

      />
    </p>

    <p>
      The effect of the above equations is to closely fit a straightforward
      gamma 2.2 curve with an slight offset to allow for invertability in
      integer math. Therefore, we are maintaining consistency with the gamma 2.2
      legacy images and the video industry as described previously.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, the nonlinear sR'G'B' values are converted to digital code
      values. This conversion scales the above sR'G'B' values by using the
      equation below where WDC represents the white digital count and KDC
      represents the black digital count.
    </p>

      This current specification proposes using a black digital count of 0 and a

      Digital broadcast television uses a black digital count of 16 and a white
      digital count of 235 in order to provide a larger encoded color gamut. We
      do not propose using this encoding at this time, due to the large legacy
      of images and applications using the previous black and white digital
      coding counts. However, it is vital to allow for a future revision to
      provide this capability.

    <h2>Color Spaces</h2>
    <p>
      <i><b>Definition:</b></i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i
        >A color space is a model for representing color numerically in terms of
        three or more coordinates. e.g. The RGB color space represents colors in
        terms of the Red, Green and Blue coordinates.
      </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      For color to be reproduced in a predictable manner across different
      devices and materials, it has to be described in a way that is independent
      of the specific behavior of the mechanisms and materials used to produce
      it. For instance, color CRTs and color printers use very different
      mechanisms for producing color. To address this issue, current methods
      require that color be described using device independent color
      coordinates, which are translated into device dependent color coordinates
      for each device.
    </p>

    <h2>Color Management</h2>
    <p>
      <i><b>Definition:</b></i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i
        >Color management is a term that describes a technology that translates
        the colors of an object (images, graphics or text) from their current
        color space to the color space of the output devices like monitors,
        printers, ...</i
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      Traditionally, operating systems have supported color by declaring support
      for a particular color space, RGB in most cases. However, since RGB varies
      between devices, color was not reliably reproduced across different
      devices.
    </p>

    <p>
      The high-end publishing market could not meet its needs with the
      traditional means of color support, so the various OS's added support for
      using International Color Consortium (ICC) profiles to characterize device
      dependent colors in a device independent way. They use the profiles of the
      input device that created an image and the output device that displayed
      the image and create a transform that moves the image from the input
      device's color space to the output device's color space. This resulted in
      very accurate color. However, it also involved the overhead of
      transporting the input device's profile with the image and running the
      image through the transform.
    </p>

    <p>
      HP and Microsoft propose an additional means of managing color that is
      optimized to meet the needs of most users without the overhead of carrying
      an ICC profile with the image: the addition to the OS and the Internet of
      support for a Standard Color Space. Since the image is in a known color
      space and the profile for that color space would ship with the OS and
      browser, this enables the end users to enjoy the benefits of color
      management without the overhead of larger files. While it may be argued
      that profiles could buy slightly higher color accuracy, we believe that
      the benefits of using a standard color space far out-weigh the drawbacks
      for a wide range of users. The migration of devices to natively support
      the standard color space will further enhance the speed and quality of the
      user experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are proposing the use of the color space, sRGB, that is consistent with
      but is a more tightly defined derivative of Rec. ITU-R BT.709 as the
      standard color space for the OS's and the Internet. In April of 1990 this
      space obtained unanimous worldwide agreement as the calibrated nonlinear
      RGB space for HDTV production and program exchange.
    </p>

    <h2>Proposed Style Sheet Syntax for specifying sRGB on the Internet</h2>
    <p>
      We propose that all page elements defined in the style sheets be assumed
      to be in the sRGB color space unless embedded ICC profiles indicate
      otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
      We further propose a new CSS-1 property, <tt>rendering-intent</tt>, with
      the following syntax to specify the user rendering intents of page
      elements. These rendering intent values are defined to be consistent with
      the
      <a href="http://www.color.org">International Color Consortium</a>
      rendering intent values (http://www.color.org) of saturation, perceptual,
      absolute colorimetric and relative colorimetric.
    </p>

    <p>Syntax</p>

    <pre>
Value: saturation | perceptual | absolute  | relative
Initial: perceptual
Applies to: all elements
Inherited: yes
Percentage values: N/A
</pre
    >

    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>
BODY { rendering-intent: saturation }
IMG.perceptualintent { rendering-intent: perceptual }
#mypic001 { rendering-intent: A }
&lt;IMG ID=mypic001 SRC=&quot;<u>http://www.site.com/layout.mypic001.png</u>&quot;&gt;
&lt;IMG CLASS=&quot;perceptualintent&quot; SRC=&quot;<u>http://www.site.com/layout.mypic002.gif</u>&quot;&gt;
</pre

    <h2>Standard Color Space in Practice</h2>
    <p>
      Once page elements are converted to sRGB, the browser needs to interpret
      the color space correctly and use the OS color management to image the
      page. The following table summarizes how the browser handles color
      management in each of the possible scenarios.

    <h2>Browsing Scenarios</h2>
    <p>
      The following cases describe what an end-user sees in the various
      scenarios:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <b
          >Image not in sRGB, does not have an embedded ICC profile, and no
          monitor/output device ICC profile</b
        >

        <p>
          This is the behavior before color management systems were added. Even
          though the image is assumed to be in sRGB color space, it is imaged
          (displayed, printed etc.) without translation to the device color
          space since the output profile is not available. The quality varies
          tremendously since output device characteristics differ greatly.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b
          >Image not in sRGB, does not have an embedded ICC profile, and system
          has a monitor/output device ICC profile</b
        >

        <p>
          Since the image has no ICC profile, it is assumed to be in the sRGB
          color space. In this scenario, the resulting image will be consistent
          across devices; however it could be different from the original image.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Image in sRGB, and no monitor/output device ICC profile</b>

        <p>
          In this scenario, the image has been run through a transform that
          consists of the input device ICC profile, and the sRGB ICC profile, or
          it was created using devices that conform to sRGB. However, since the
          system has no ICC profile for the output device, it will simply assume
          the image is in the device's color space. If all the images rendered
          on the output device are in sRGB, then they will at least be
          consistent with respect to each other on a given monitor/output
          device.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Image in sRGB, and system has a monitor/output device ICC profile</b>

        <p>
          In this scenario, the image has been run through a transform that
          consists of the input device ICC profile, and the sRGB ICC profile, or
          it was created using devices that conform to sRGB. Because the system
          has an ICC profile for the output device, the image can be converted
          to the output device's color space and imaged. The resulting image
          will be consistent across devices, and will be very close to the
          original in appearance.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Image in sRGB, and monitor/output device is sRGB compliant</b>

        <p>
          In this scenario, the image has been run through a transform that
          consists of the input device ICC profile, and the sRGB ICC profile, or
          it was created using devices that conform to sRGB. As the output
          device has been designed to conform with sRGB, and is associated with
          that ICC profile, a transform is not necessary for this case. The OS
          realizes that no transformation is required and simply images the
          image directly on the output device. This case is ideal since there is
          no color transformation at output time, and the image is more compact
          since there is no ICC profile embedded in it. The resulting image will
          be consistent across devices, and will be very close to the original
          in appearance.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b
          >Image not in sRGB, has an embedded ICC profile, and no monitor/output
          device ICC profile</b
        >

        <p>
          This would be treated the same as the &quot;Image not in sRGB, does
          not have an embedded ICC profile, and no monitor/output device ICC
          profile&quot; scenario.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b
          >Image not in sRGB, has an embedded ICC profile, and system has a
          monitor/output device ICC profile</b
        >

        <p>
          This is the standard color management scenario. The two ICC profiles
          are combined to produce a transform that will map the colors of the
          image into the output device's color space. The resulting image will
          be consistent across devices, and will be very close to the original
          in appearance.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Authoring Scenarios</h2>
    <p>
      The following scenarios describe how to get an image into the sRGB color
      space when creating it.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <b
          >Image created on a device that has no ICC profiles and is not sRGB
          compliant</b
        >

        <p>
          Display the image on a monitor that is sRGB compliant or that has an
          ICC profile. Edit the image until it looks good on the monitor. For
          monitors that are not sRGB compliant but have ICC profiles, depending
          on the capabilities of the application, either use the application to
          save the image as sRGB or embed the monitor's profile into the image,
          and use a tool to create a transform with the monitor's profile and
          the sRGB profile and run the image through the transform. If the image
          file format supports it, specify the image is in sRGB.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b
          >Image created on a device that has ICC profiles and is not sRGB
          compliant</b
        >

        <p>
          Use a tool to create a transform with device's profile and the sRGB
          profile. Then run the image through the transform, specify the image
          is in sRGB if the image file format supports it.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Image created on a device that is sRGB compliant</b>

        <p>
          Specify the image is in sRGB if the image file format supports this.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Suggestions to benefit from sRGB</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        CRT manufacturers who build monitors in compliance with the sRGB
        specification will get faster display times for objects in this color
        space. (No transformation needs to occur.)
      </li>

      <li>
        Scanner and digital camera manufacturers who optimize the color
        transforms and gamma correction for compatibility with sRGB will benefit
        for the same reason.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Palette Issues</h2>
    <p>
      There are several different scenarios to consider when dealing with
      palettized images and displays.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <b
          >Image does not have a color table (&gt; 8bpp), and client monitor is
          not palettized</b
        >

        <p>
          The image is run through a color matching transform as described in
          the previous section, and the resulting 24bpp image is displayed on
          the monitor.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b
          >Image has a color table (8bpp) and client monitor is not
          palettized</b
        >

        <p>
          The color table accompanying the image is run through a color
          matching, and the resulting color table is used with the image for
          display. The displayed image is very close to original image.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b
          >Image does not have a color table (&gt;8bpp) and client monitor is
          palettized.</b
        >

        <p>
          The software displaying the image (eg. browser) should use the default
          palette that is defined in sRGB space, convert it into device color
          space by running it through a color matching transform, and use this
          palette to display the image. The resulting image gets dithered into
          the closest possible colors on the display. The assumption is that the
          monitor profile is created with the default palette selected.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b
          >Image has a color table (8bpp) and was created using the default
          palette and client monitor is palettized</b
        >

        <p>
          The software displaying the image should follow the same steps as
          above. The resulting image is very close to the original image and
          unintentional dithering is eliminated. If the original image only had
          colors in the default palette, the final image doesn't have any
          dithering.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b
          >Image has a color table (8bpp) and was created using an arbitrary
          palette and client monitor is palettized</b
        >

        <p>
          <!--At this point in time, we recommend to <I>not </I>color
manage this scenario.</p>-->

          If the client monitor only has a palettized profile and can only
          display the image by discarding this profiled palette and replacing it
          with an uncalibrated palette, we do <em>not</em> recommend to color
          manage this scenario. If the client monitor is able to treat the image
          as if it was a truecolor (unpalettized) image, it should proceed as
          for case 3 above.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Note that cases 3 and 4 assume an industry standard default palette
      defined in sRGB color space that will be used by authoring and display
      software to handle 8bpp images. Microsoft and HP are working on the
      definition of such a palette.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      We believe that the addition of standard color space, sRGB, support to the
      Internet, device drivers and operating systems is a complementary addition
      to the existing color management support that utilizes and expands the
      benefits and availability of color management to a broader range of users.
      Furthermore, we believe that sRGB overcomes many application developer and
      end-user reservations to adopting color management. The call for action
      below presents a clear path forward to improved color management.
    </p>

    <h2>Call for action</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        OS and authoring tools should utilize CRT calibration methods to ensure
        that images created locally on the monitor are properly translated into
        sRGB.
      </li>

      <li>
        Authoring tools should enable the use of the OS color management tools
        to transform the incoming images into sRGB by combining the incoming
        device ICC profiles with the sRGB ICC profile. These images will be
        stored in the original file format (like GIF, PNG and JPEG), but with
        the correct colors.
      </li>

      <li>
        Authoring tools should enable the user to view and edit text and
        graphics in sRGB.
      </li>

      <li>Web page creators should publish content in sRGB.</li>
      <li>
        Browser vendors should support the style sheet extensions proposed above
        and use the OS color management tools to ensure that colors are properly
        displayed.
      </li>

      <li>
        Organizations that create and support file formats should ensure that
        the file formats encompass the ability to embed profiles and declare
        their color space.
      </li>
    </ol>
