## The Open Web Platform is Transforming Payments

To help ensure that the Web evolves to meet new industry needs, we’re convening **banks, processors, regulators, card networks, e-commerce companies, telecom operators, multiple service operators (MSOs), hardware vendors, browser and software vendors** and others who are shaping the way Web Payments are developed, to discuss topics such as:

- Reducing cart abandonment rates.
- Reducing security fraud.
- Fostering digital payment method innovation both on the Web and in-store.
- Facilitating digital offers including loyalty programs and coupons.
- Addressing payments in more device contexts such as in-car payments, Internet of Things payments and virtual reality payments.
- The impact of emerging regulations on Web architecture and capabilities.
- Harmonization with other standards efforts such as FIDO authentication, EMVCo tokenization and 3D Secure, and others.

## [Payments at W3C](#payments_w3c)

The overarching goal of W3C is to create and provide Open Web Standards. To help us achieve that goal, it’s imperative that those with interest and knowledge about Web Payments and Security get involved with the Consortium. The more voices and ideas we have, the better we can implement these standards.

![collection of web payments icons](https://www.w3.org/comm/assets/stock/shutterstock_603363221-500px.png)W3C has two main Web Payment-focused groups. The [Web Payment Working Group](/Payments/WG/) works to create and implement software and APIs to make web payments easier and more secure. The [Web Payment Security Interest Group](/securepay/) provides a forum for discussion and implementation of new security standards. It also allows members to discover and fix gaps in interoperability of W3C’s standards and APIs.

By joining these W3C Web Payments groups, you have the ability to discuss and drive the standards produced by W3C. The conversations occurring in the groups concern both current and future standards, constantly aiming to make the Web a better place to buy and sell. You have the ability to take part in guiding the future of the web. Voice your concerns and ideas, and keep the future of the Web bright!

### What are we doing right now?

- Focusing on deliverable APIs to increase the convenience and security of Web Payments
- Increasing security across the field of payments on the Web
- Gathering voices to guide the next phase of payments on the Web

Standardization is essential to continue to work towards this future of payments.
