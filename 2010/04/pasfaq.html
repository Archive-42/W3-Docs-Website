    <h2 id="L373">What is the PAS Submission process (for ISO/IEC JTC 1) ?</h2>

    <p>
      "PAS" refers to "Publicly Available Specification" and is an
      <strong>ISO/IEC JTC 1 transposition</strong> procedure whereby
      organizations accredited as valid
      <a
        href="http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&amp;objId=8913248&amp;objAction=browse&amp;sort=name"
        >PAS Submitters</a
      >
      can send their specifications directly for country voting, to become
      ISO/IEC standards.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the end of October 2010, after a 3-month ballot completed by national
      members of ISO/IEC JTC 1, W3C was approved as a JTC 1
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/03/w3c-pas-submission.html">Recognized</a>
      PAS Submitter for an overall scope defined as "<strong
        >any stable core Web technologies produced by W3C that are also in scope
        of JTC 1</strong
      >".
    </p>

    <h2 id="L388">How does the community benefit from this process ?</h2>

    <p>
      There are contexts where having the de-jure standard imprimatur is likely
      to <strong>increase adoption</strong> of W3C specifications. For instance,
      beyond the W3C brand, a larger audience may be familiar with the ISO and
      IEC brands. Furthermore, there are also contexts where it is mandatory to
      use ISO/IEC standards or their national transposition by legislation, for
      instance in some government procurement.
    </p>

    <p>
      W3C also has experience where lack of coordination among standards bodies
      results in <strong>fragmentation</strong>. The PAS process can be seen as
      a mechanism for better coordination between different standardization
      cultures, all of which seek global interoperability for ICT technologies,
      but through different means. This coordination can result in
      <strong>lower entry costs</strong> on the Web platform for the community
      at large.
    </p>

    <p>
      As other
      <a

        >peer organizations</a
      >
      have done W3C has therefore decided to apply for JTC 1 PAS Status over the
      summer 2010 and was granted PAS submitter status subsequently, with 21 yes
      votes, 13 abstain, and 0 no vote.
    </p>

    <p>
      Together with our
      <a
        href="http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2122/327993/755080/5860393/Approved_RS_Originator_Organizations_AROs_.html?nodeid=7500268&amp;vernum=0"
        >ARO</a
      >
      status (allowing ISO specs to reference W3C Recommendations), W3C believes
      that de jure recognition of W3C specifications will add trust to the
      entire international standard system, so that end-users benefit from
      <strong>better interoperability</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="L416">How are the specifications selected?</h2>

    <p>
      The scope of our application is "<strong>Core Web Technologies</strong>",
      defined in our proposal as "any stable core Web technologies produced by
      W3C that are also in scope of ISO/IEC JTC 1". That establishes a baseline
      of what we may submit. For instance, some of Recommedations are tutorials,
      tests, primers, and those would not belong in the PAS potential set.
    </p>

        >Selection Process</a
      >
      for handling future PAS is being developed and reviewed within W3C, the
      goal being to submit specifications that help avoid market fragmentation,
      improve deployment and facilitate government procurement, and at the same
      time are stable and widely accepted.
    </p>

    <p></p>

    <h2 id="L430">What specifications have been submitted ?</h2>

    <p>
      Our first package
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/08/ws-pas.html">PAS on Web Services</a>
      (SOAP 1.2, MTOM, WS Addr and WS Policy) was sent to ISO on Jan 21th 2011
      and approved on July 25th 2011.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second package,
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/tr/wcag20"
        >Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a
      >
      was
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9590">announced as approved</a>
      on 15 October 2012.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our third PAS, on
      <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/4770?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=mathml-3-0-becomes-isoiec-international-standard"
        >MathML 3.0</a
      >
      has been approved beginning of 2015.
    </p>

    <h2 id="L444">What specifications are being considered for future PAS ?</h2>

    <p>Nothing has been decided for 2015 and beyond for now.</p>

    <h2 id="L450">
      What is the relationship between the W3C Royalty-Free patent policy and
      the ISO/IEC patent policy?
    </h2>

    <p>
      W3C Recommendations benefit from Royalty-Free licensing commitments, while
      JTC 1 has a RAND patent policy. Since RF is a special case of RAND where
      the only applicable Reasonable fee is zero, we do not foresee any issue
      here. W3C specifications will continue to be subject to the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/"
        >W3C Patent Policy</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond patents, W3C's
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/03/w3c-pas-submission.html"
        >PAS submitter application</a
      >
      also addresses how we expect to manage copyright, maintenance,
      dissemination, testing, translations, co-branding, and so on.
    </p>

    <h2 id="L462">
      What can be done to make the ISO/W3C collaboration even more productive ?
    </h2>

    <p>
      There may be ways to make it even easier for a W3C Specification to move
      to the PAS process. For instance, both W3C and ISO have specific timelines
      for review as part of their respective processes, often done by overlaping
      sets of experts, e.g. W3C members being active in their national ISO
      organization. We may wish to synchronize those reviews (which, under
      current processes, take place at different times). This sort of
      optimization might require some changes to the W3C process, but more
      experience and discussion would be required before any changes are
      proposed.
    </p>

    <p>
      On a practical side, W3C already engages in lots of
      <a href="/2001/11/StdLiaison">liaisons</a> between ISO committees and W3C
      Working Groups.
